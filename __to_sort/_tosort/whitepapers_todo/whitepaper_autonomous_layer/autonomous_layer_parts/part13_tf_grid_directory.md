### Grid data: TF Grid Directory

In this blockchain database, the builders of the grid (farmers) and their equipment (nodes) are stored and searchable for anyone to create a marketplace that makes the supply searchable for people who need (demand) compute, storage, and network capacity.

The information stored in this blockchain database for farmer and nodes is:



*   Unique global ID (is a nr)
*   A chosen name (can be a GUID or a name per node – is a free field, is like a DNS name)
*   Address = the 3Bot name who represents this node
*   Data field which has info about the node
    *   Farmer ID
    *   Capacity  (resource units: Compute Unit, Storage Unit, Network Unit)

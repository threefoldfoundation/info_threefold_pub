### Contract data: TF Notary Service

The TF Grid is a busy place with people setting commercial rates and terms and conditions for their farming capacity, consumers searching and contracting services, data is being dispersed and stored, and IT architectures recipes are being created and used. For all these activities, the notary service provides an immutable, always appended contract and activity notary system in which all digital records are stored. Eventually, there will be more than one TF Notary blockchain to allow scalability of the system.

The following information is stored:



*   Unique global ID (is a nr)
*   A chosen name (can be a GUID or a name per node – is free field, is like a DNS name. The blockchain makes sure this chosen name is unique)
*   Address  = the 3Bot who owns this registered information (optional)
*   Data field which has the info to be registered (can be any format but max 2000 characters in size)

This is a generic usable data store for any application, it is a possible backend for the application layer.

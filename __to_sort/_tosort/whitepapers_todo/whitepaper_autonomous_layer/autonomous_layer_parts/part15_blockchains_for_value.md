### TFT or any other digital currency Blockchain

Threefold has created its own blockchain technology called Rivine which is used to sell and buy capacity on the ThreeFold_Grid.

### Digital Currency Blockchain As A Service

Complementary Digital currencies are here to stay. Complementary currencies are not new and have always been around to compensate for when main (fiat) currencies fail. In the last decade, digital complementary currencies have gained the interest and respect of many people globally. They represent opportunities for people that have no access to traditional banking services. They provide alternative means of value transfer between individuals and legal entities, making it more effective, with lower cost, and independent of traditional value exchange mechanisms.

Like traditional mileage systems of airlines (which is an example of a complementary digital currency) many more of these will come into existence over the next couple of years. The local football club might come up with their own value exchange mechanism for running their own internal economy in such a way that is specific to the football club, branded to the football club, and has supporters exchanging value amongst each other, with the fan shop, in the cafeteria, and canteens.

With the TF Grid as a platform to run on, anyone can start their own digital currency for a particular use case. TF Grid is compatible with any blockchain technology. It will create a system for value exchange and the necessary governance and consensus by people who co-own and operate the specific local blockchain.

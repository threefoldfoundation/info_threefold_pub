# Get TFT to FLY.

Based on utilization rather than hype.

## Key drivers for valuation increase & liquidity

- **scarcity**
    - developers and application providers need to stake TFT before they can use 
    - digital twin leads to serious burning
    - farming results in more staking & more burning
    - vesting = liquidity limited: only 260m today (< 20m USD marketcap)
    - max 4 billion TFT
- **utilization**
    - digital twin
    - kubernetes cloud
    - quantum safe filesystem
    - ecosystem of partners
      - artheon
      - ...
    - software vendors use TFGrid as the basis for their deployments
- **friction less purchase of TFT**
    - FIAT to TFT gateways
    - Peer2Peer exchange: BTC, DGB, TFT, GoldToken, CoffeeToken
    - DEFI = be on multiple DEFI platforms
    - Peer2Peer liquidity providing
- **rebranding of TFT for an ICO**
    - an ICO is being prepared for a rebranded TFT
    - each current TFT holder will be able to participate if they would want to
    - this ICO is not driven by ThreeFold, a 3e party does all but will respect the interests of our current TFT holders.
- **organic marketing**
    - PR
    - roadshows
    - ...

## anti drivers for sustainable valuation

- unfounded hype
- unfounded speculation (fake marketmaking, pump & dump)
- fake marketing or promotion

Do not accept us to be yet another pump & dump scheme.

We will grow organically and show the world how we create value.


## Scarcity Explanation

### Staking Need for Internet Capacity

!!!include:tfgrid:staking_discount_levels0

This means if average person stakes for 12 months, and the grid does 1 Billion USD in revenue per year (which is low compared to world) and there are 1000m TFT liquid from which 50% are staked then the TFT price needs to be at least 2 USD.

### Digital Twin Use Case

There will be 10m Digital Twin's for life made available to sell (is a token by itself).
Each Digital Twin give unlimited free access to all experiences as developed by ACI (today we already have alternative to Whatsapp, Google Docs, Dropbox, Zoom, ...).

the digital twins will be sold as follows

| nr twins | TFT            |
| -------- | -------------- |
| 1m       | 100 USD in TFT |
| 2m       | 110 USD in TFT |
| 3m       | 120 USD in TFT |
| 4m       | 130 USD in TFT |
| 5m       | 140 USD in TFT |
| 6m       | 150 USD in TFT |
| 7m       | 160 USD in TFT |
| 8m       | 170 USD in TFT |
| 9m       | 180 USD in TFT |
| 10m      | 190 USD in TFT |

- 25% of these TFT are burned
- 75% -> goes to ACI for funding of the beautiful projects of this accelerator which will drive even more utilization.

if the avg TFT price is 1.1 USD until we have 10m twins sold -> this leads to almost 500m TFT burned which is way more than current marketcap. In other words TFT price needs to be higher.

### Farming model leads to Staking & Burning.

Each new node added to the TFGrid adds about 6x less TFT (as result of farming) compared to total amount of TFT required to use all capacity.

Or in other words farming is 6x undervalued.

25% of the TFT are burned which means once the grid is more utilized more TFT can potentially be burned than farmed.

Each node added, leads to more capacity which leads to more utilization which leads to more staking requirement, see above.


### Nr Tokens & Vesting

- max 4 Billion TFT leads to a healthy maximum amount of TFT.
- vesting helps in the beginning to keep nr of liquid TFT low (today less than 7%)

## Utilization & Promotion Explanation

- digital twin promotion
  - burning man team will promote digital twin on large scale basis: end Q3
  - 2.5m students promote through TAG
  - digital twin for life action will through community push purchase
- Quantum Safe Filesystem & Kubernetes Cloud
  - Digibyte community +1m people starting Q4
  - Own marketing actions starting Sept 2021
- Artheon = largest virtual reality museum + alternative to Minecraft
  - the most beautiful VR platform in the world
- software vendors
  - we are close to signing with some major vendor with millions of users ...
- ACP
  - ACP is working on incredible projects which will lead to huge utilization of TFGrid
- ...

> The pricing is super competitive and huge discounts because of staking. This will lead to friction less sales of TFGrid IT capacity.

## friction less purchase of TFT

### FIAT (GOLD) to TFT gateways

Multiple gateways will launch sept 2021

Q4 there will be large scale Gold to TFT gateway launching, this makes it super easy for everyone to get into TFT, just an IBAN transfer is all it takes.

### Peer2Peer exchange & liquidity providing

Everyone will be able to exchange between BTC, DGB, TFT, GoldToken, CoffeeToken without any friction.

We are fundraising to have enough funds for liquidity providing for this platform.

Will launch Q4 2021

### DEFI = be on multiple DEFI platforms

We are today already on Binance smartchain but there is no marketing yet.
We want to leverager other DEFI platforms.


## Investors

We are fundraising for large liquidity pool of 10m USD.

There is only 20 m USD liquid marketcap today (July 2021)

The liquidity pool functions as follows

- we buy everything we can < 0.1 from the exchanges, we do it carefully
- we buy 1m USD from ThreeFold promotion pool at 0.1 once price is +0.1 USD
- we operate the liquidity pool on multiple DEFI exchanges

## Roadmap

- Technical/Operational
  - TFGrid 2.8 active today, everyone can play on testnet
  - TFGrid 3.0 (beta) Sept 2021

    - Kubernetes Cloud in production 
    - Quantum Safe filesystem in production
  - Digital Twin in demo for investors Now

## Remarks

- do not expect quick pump & dump
- value will be result of organic growth
- the revenue is recurring which leads in hockey stick growth
- the cloud and our digital life is an endless blue ocean market, endless opportunity

## FAQ

### The TFT price is low, are we worried.

It's super annoying that the market does not appreciate our real value yet but at the other hand it allows investors to come in and buy Tokens at a very cheap price.

### are public exchanges a must to let the TFT grow in value?

Public exchanges are a required chanel if speculation is the main way for a token to grow in value.

But there are some issues with them, larger public exchanges are typically expensive and there is a lot of speculation.

Sorry to say so, but we believe public exchanges have a lot of simularities to casinos, the average person does not understand how it works and many are making mistakes which can cost them a lot of money. Huge market makers make the money based on pre-knowledge and AI driven trading bots. The house never loses.

We believe a crash will come and so will more regulations, this will help us to grow our token based on real value and technology, our foundations are sound and will lead to a healthy TFT price.

Potentially there could be even a strategy to take TFT off public exchanges somewhere in 2022, and rely on the other mechanisms we will have in place which could potentially provide more value for the TFT holders. Scarcity & utilization need to be the biggest drivers. No decision or even close to agreement has been achieved around this topic, this is just an idea.

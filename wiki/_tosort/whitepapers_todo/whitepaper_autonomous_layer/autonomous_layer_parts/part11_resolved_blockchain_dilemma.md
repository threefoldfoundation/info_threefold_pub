# ThreeFold Blockchain Technology 


## Thanks to the TFGrid the Blockchain Dilemma has been resolved 

Blockchain comes in two varieties: based on public nodes (everyone can partake) and private nodes (a known, limited amount of nodes partaking). They both have their advantages as shown in the diagram below:

The specifics of both implementations lead to the so-called blockchain dilemma – both represent good features and have specific advantages but they have not been able to be combined into one.

A permissioned blockchain setup requires people. In our setup, that is not the case. And because of this, the blockchain dilemma problem does not apply any longer.

Our technology is the missing layer for blockchain and can be used to make any blockchain technology more scalable, sustainable, efficient and secure.

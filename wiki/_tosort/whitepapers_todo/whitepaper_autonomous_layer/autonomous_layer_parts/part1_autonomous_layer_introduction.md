# Autonomous Layer

ThreeFold's technology has been developed to run any IT workload 100% autonomously. 

For the last couple of years, blockchain was synonymous with decentralization. However, blockchains are not necessarily decentralized, they are distributed systems.

According to us, real decentralization happens when people and organizations become the center of their digital life.

To achieve this form of decentralization, every human or legal entity should have a digital avatar, that represents their digital self. This avatar is an application running in a well-protected environment, that remains online all the time, and that can interact with any other digital avatar in full freedom and efficiency. This model inspires itself of how cells work in a human body. All together the cells create a functioning digital world, based on collaboration.

# 3Bot 

3Bot represents your digital self and has been designed to be as efficient as possible. The current memory footprint of a 3Bot is less than 200MB, yet it still has a wiki system, database, blockchain, web server, indexing & search machine, e-commerce system, wallet, decentralized exchange, and more functionalities. It can manage millions of objects and is the center of a person's or entity's digital life.

To create 3Bot, there was no other way than to start from scratch and re-invent a lot of principles because existing IT components are too centralized and often too inefficient (e.g. memory hungry).

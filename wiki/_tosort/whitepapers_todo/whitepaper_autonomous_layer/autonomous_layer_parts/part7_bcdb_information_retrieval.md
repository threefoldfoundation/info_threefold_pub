## BCDB is the most efficient information retrieval system possible

In the current Internet, retrieving information happens in two ways:

**1. Centralized**

*   Based on a URL (a unique resource locator), which is typically rather long
*   A URL can only be used in a centralized context. It has been designed for that purpose. 
    *   _Example URL: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1555434992-f1670f5e8fce?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=934&q=80_
*   Today +99% of all information is stored this way
*   You have to rely on the provider of the information (normally not the author) to deliver good uptime and enough connectivity to the Internet.

**2. Distributed**

Blockchain or other distributed databases

*   A long key e.g. 32 characters, or even 64
*   The data is distributed (sometimes replicated) over big areas – the data is not linked to the author but spread over a large area controlled by a blockchain or by a centralized application
*   The lookup process is typically slow – a special algorithm allows you to find the information in multiple steps, and there is no guarantee that the data is close to you when you need it.


## ThreeFold Peer-to-Peer System

P2P circular decentralized system there is only need for two numbers, to retrieve any information in the world. One number is to find which digital avatar to talk to, the other number is to find the information in the digital avatar of the data owner (can be a human person or other legal entity).

Information can be a movie, for example, or a single piece of information like your email address. Each digital avatar is responsible for retrieving & reconstructing the information from the underlying IT capacity network (the nodes on a decentralized internet). This happens in a very secure way and the digital avatar is the only digital entity capable of re-assembling the information in such a way it makes sense again. This leads to very strong security.

**With only two numbers any information in the world can be addressed.**

This way of how to address information has far-reaching implications and can change the way how the Internet works.

## Blockchain Basics

A blockchain is as the word says a chain of blocks of information. As shown in the graphic below the “blocks” contain information on transactions.  Transactions are the transfer of value of a digital currency (tokens_home) from wallet A to wallet B.  The “chain” aspect comes is where a part of the information stored in a block is a link to the previous block (a unique number).  This is a very simple representation of what a blockchain is.

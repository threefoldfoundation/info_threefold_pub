## Blockchain myths undone 

So blockchains are a great new technology but they are not the answer to everything.  Just like with any other technology or tool you need to carefully consider if the use case considered is appropriate. In the end, it is just neutral characteristics that might be a reason for applying a blockchain or not:



*   is there a need for decentralisation?
*   is there a need for immutability ?

Blockchain technology for a specific purpose needs to be carefully considered and if found appropriate then to be implemented. Humans play a key role in this decision process and are even needed to find a solution for all the flaws blockchains brings along

 

Scalability, security, trustworthiness, functionality are to be added by humans to blockchain deployments. Decentralisation and immutability can be done by blockchain technology alone.

 

This delicate mix of ingredients to be brought together are very likely the reason why many projects in the blockchain space don’t fly, even though there is a rightful claim about the disruptive nature of the technology.

Two frequent mistakes are made:



*   Either the technology is used as the ultimate goal to solve all the problems such as described above, and that will lead to failure in the end, because blockchain can’t fulfil these promises
*   Or the technology is used under the false pretext that decentralisation is wanted, whereas the true intention is to be in control. Blockchain thinking requires also a completely different way of thinking compared to the classical thinking embedded in the heart of our economy: concentration of power & control and competition need to make room for decentralisation and collaboration.

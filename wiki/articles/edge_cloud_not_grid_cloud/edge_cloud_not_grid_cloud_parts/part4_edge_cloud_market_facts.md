## Edge Computing market Facts

Due to the billions of IoT devices driven by various use cases like autonomous driving,  a huge demand for Edge Computing is evolving rapidly. According to the Digital Journal, the Edge Computing market is growing extremely fast. With a  CAGR of over 35.0%  and  the market is expected to  reach  USD 33.75 billion by the end of 2023.

Edge Computing and Grid Computing are often used in the same context and sometimes are confused. For the purpose of this whitepaper,we’d like to define the terms going forward as follows: 

Grid Computing means a computer network of 100% distributed computer resources like processing power, memory and data storage of similar or different types to which authorized people have access to in order to run their computation workloads.That means that Grid Compute nodes  are mostly in data centers and may be dispersed over wider regions but are typically still far from the edge. In comparison to Edge Computing,  Grid Computing environments are owned by more than one individual or company, and thus, controlled by many.

Edge computing has risen from a need to have data processing and storage as close as possible to real world situations.  Situations is a generic term used here to describe that it can be something as simple as recoding biometric data by a smartwatch to supporting the required information of making a self driving car do what it needs to do.  The necessity comes from having to have locality in terms of compute and storage capacity - it can be used my multiple use cases (situations) but does not have to.

In this whitepaper we will focus specifically on edge computing and see what  is required to make that work in the best possible way.  However we will see that there is a link back to grid computing at the end of the paper.

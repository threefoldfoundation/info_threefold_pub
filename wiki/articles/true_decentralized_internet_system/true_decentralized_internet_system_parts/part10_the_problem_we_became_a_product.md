## The problem: we became a product.

DATA = IS THE NEW OIL …

Our data is the most important asset we have. Companies like Facebook and Google needs lots of our data to function.

In our world, profit is the main driving force of our society, reducing us to a product in a big services machine. We no longer exist as an independent person, we exist as targets in a big Artificially Driven machine programed to maximize profit. Our data is the most valuable asset in this world.

Next to the unethical behaviour of above paradigm there are also huge side effects in the way how these systems have been built.

Most of us exist more than 50 times in such a system. Each time you register for a new service you actually create a new digital identity. You only have partial control over these identities and it leads to very inefficient behaviour.

Some examples:



*   Your digital life is complicated,e.g. your need to remember how to communicate with who and which tools to use, you need to learn how to use multiple tools in a lot of detail.
*   Because you exist +50 times, compute & storage power required to deal with these services are duplicated 50 times. This means 50 times more world resources are used than really required.
*   Your data resides on many locations and is not really managed by you.
*   You’re services are very centralized and as such you have to digitally travel far to reach those services, leading in less performance, more  cables, less healthy technologies (5G)
*   The data centers hosting these applications are huge and very power hungry, while in reality they are not needed.

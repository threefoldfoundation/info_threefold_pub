## ThreeFold Technology 


### Architecture 


![alt_text](img/tf_architecture.png)


_Architecture: The 3Bots live on top of the grid of capacity  \
and as such there is unlimited scalability._


### The 3 layers 

![alt_text](img/layers.png)


The system consists out of multiple layers, a technical user can create their solutions on any of those layers without needing to know about the other layer e.g. an application developer does not have to know about the capacity layer, but a low level IT expert can deploy his applications directly on the capacity layer.


### Communication Flows 


![alt_text](img/smart_contract_for_it_steps.png)


_Information flow documented where a user retrieves a video from his/her phone._

_Each piece of information gets addressed with only 2 numbers, which makes it very scalable._

_All 3Bots are registered on a blockchain (like a phonebook) which makes it secure and efficient._

_Data is dispersed over the grid onto multiple nodes providing ultimate security._

### Some advantages for the users of this system 



*   More Performance
    *   Decentralized Video/Voice conferencing is faster.
    *   Access to information is much faster because information is closer to you.
*   More Convenience
    *   Because all the apps are built using the same backend system which is basically you, the convenience will be much higher.  E.g. integrated payments, ...
    *   Easier combination of services.
*   Lower Cost of Services and Products
    *   The more efficient system and elimination of certain unneeded middleman will lead to much lower cost of services or products.
    *   We believe for certain services the difference can be substantial like up to 50%
*   More transparency and information about the source of the service/product
    *   Thanks to the 3Bot technology it is possible to track the origin of the service you use.
*   Build in fair & neutral reputation system improves quality
    *   The built in reputation system makes sure that quality and price are aligned.
    *   The 3Bot verification mechanisms are fair and neutral
*   Access to more (educational) information	
    *   All information at your fingertips
*   Less manipulation	
    *   The information you get will come guaranteed from sources you trust. Manipulation should be impossible.
*   Equal Rights
    *   No matter where you live, you will be able to communicate & access information.
*   Anyone can deliver services or products online and participate in the FreeFlow Economy.
    *   No need for complex e-commerce or payment systems.

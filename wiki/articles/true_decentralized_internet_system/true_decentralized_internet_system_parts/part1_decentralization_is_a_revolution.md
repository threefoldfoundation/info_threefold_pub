# Decentralization is a new revolution


![alt_text](img/balloon.png)


The world right now has known a long period of relative peace (+60 years). [Liberalism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/liberalism) was the engine behind this prosperous period. Some claim that [liberalism as we know it, could come to an end](https://www.tttdebates.org/is-liberalism-dead/). 

Liberalism is a political and moral philosophy based on liberty and equal rights (see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism)).

Personally we believe there is no better alternative to Liberalism. The values behind Liberalism are great but unfortunately the implementation has been very poor. The main reason for this poor result was centralization and too much focus on ultra efficient capitalism. 

We believe decentralization could be the tool Liberalism needs to survive. This could be the next required step in human evolution. This revolution started with Blockchain, very interesting technology, and the first step but not going far enough yet.

Thanks to the blockchain hype, a new business trend has been created, and the current solutions are only the beginning. It's a trend where customers want to see more decentralization. People want to have more control over their own lives. They don’t want to become a meaningful piece inside a big Artificial Intelligence machine.

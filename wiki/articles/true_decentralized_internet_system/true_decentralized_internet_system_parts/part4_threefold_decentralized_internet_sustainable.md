## The ThreeFold decentralized “Internet” & “IT” system is sustainable. 

Everything is a balance between efficiency and resilience (see above). In our current society, the focus is too much on efficiency which has lead to too centralized systems. Centralized systems are too fragile (boom-bust cycles) and can lead to abuse as well (we became a product in centralized data management systems e.g. Facebook, ...).

The current centralized systems or the current Current Blockchain systems are at the outer sides of this curve. 

A new system is needed with the right balance between centralization and distribution this is the true form of decentralization. We believe the right form is like a circle where we (or any legal entity) are the “center” of the de-**central**ized world. Blockchain technology is used inside your center of the circle (which we call a digital avatar) as well as finding consensus in between the circles (digital avatar). The combination of both concepts makes a sustainable, viable solution possible.

This solution would sit in the sustainable part of the curve of life.

## Status of the decentralized internet today?

Does this system exist today? Also at ThreeFold, we are not there yet **but we are very close.**

Probably further advanced compared to any other startup or technology vendor.

We had to re-invent a blockchain, an operating system, and a self-healing autonomous IT system.

**But we are very close.**

Our Zero-OS & Zero-Chain is usable and deployed today. The ThreeFold_Grid is the first deployment of this unique technology and has been activated Q2 2018.

There are more than 18.000 CPU cores and 90.000.000 GB of storage activated with this technology.

There are 3 layers of our technology (see below), the capacity layer is available since Q2 2019. This layer allows anyone to use the grid as decentralized alternative to existing clouds. Through a blockchain you define the workloads you want and it becomes reality. The large majority of workloads running on existing clouds can run on on our TF Grid today.

Since then we have been working on new technology which is making our “digital self” 3Bot service possible. This technology is not ready for prime time yet. We are close to launching an upgrade in our TF Grid where the usage of 3Bot technology will be introduced.

ThreeFold Tech is the technology company who developed this technology. ThreeFold Tech is working with chosen technology partners to roll out commercial products. To learn more about the technology which empowers our 3Bot see our technology whitepaper (links at end of document).

## Magical Coordinator

### Requirements to let actor based management work

* Less complexity

* State only with the actor itself (no-where else !!!)

* Understood language between actors 

* Process = recipes of a cook, NOT IN A DB

## Actor based IT solutions 

In order to simplify common IT architectures we should look at a   new way of creating such a system that does take the current standards into account:

* No people involved in integrating different components into a single solution

    * Which as a consequence means no revenue generation based on creating and managing complexity.

* No central state / operational data storage

* Individual automated actors with specific knowledge for specific tasks

* Independent operating actors completing specific tasks

Such a system should ideally be owned by many (not just a single organization, bring centralization back into the equations) which operate IT tasks for many.  We have not seen such a system in existence but we are as TFTech building and rolling out technology that is able to do this.

We believe that the future of IT is in decentralization where specific coordinators (bots) will roam a network of capacity looking for a task to do, making themselves available where needed, creating more of them if the system grows and allowing the global population to deploy and operate IT workloads.

# ThreeFold: Enabling the first Carbon Neutral P2P Cloud in the world.

Despite public clouds announcing carbon neutrality, it is important to realise that most of the current strategies surround the monopolization of green energy supplies to power their hyper-scale data centres. While some may say this is sustainable, it actually reduces the amount of green energy available to the rest of the economies they operate in. 

The only real way of achieving carbon neutrality, is to bring renewable energy solutions within the business model itself and to compensate for the extra energy used in the form offsets.

## How ThreeFold is achieving this milestone

- Collaborating with partners to create a collaborative carbon neutral P2P Cloud.
- Using Zero-OS - an energy efficient operating system to run P2P Cloud workloads, enabling +90% energy savings for e.g. storage workloads.
- Liquid and/or immersion cooling (to reduce cooling energy consumption)
- As part of the sales price of the P2P Cloud, a portion will be allocated to compensate for the carbon emissions of the ThreeFold Grid, and converted into carbon credits.
- The carbon credits will be re-invested in projects such as TAG where 2,5+ million students from all around the world collaborative on planet positive projects to fight climate change.

### What is a carbon offset?

A carbon offset is a reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases made in order to compensate for emissions made elsewhere. Offsets are measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent. One tonne of carbon offset represents the reduction of one tonne of carbon dioxide or its equivalent in other greenhouse gases

### What is a carbon credit?

A carbon credit is a generic term for any tradable certificate or permit representing the right to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide or the equivalent amount of a different greenhouse gas. Carbon credits and carbon markets are a component of national and international attempts to mitigate the growth in concentrations of greenhouse gases.

# What is ThreeFold Peer-to-Peer Cloud?

ThreeFold P2P Cloud is a peer-to-peer network of compute and storage, that is integrated and compatible to the most used developer tools and formats. It uses autonomous and p2p technology to provide the most decentralized, secure and efficient infrastructure to build and store information. 

On ThreeFold P2P Cloud, users store and run their files directly on the operating-system of the servers (3Nodes) connected to the ThreeFold Grid, provided by independent actors. The available compute and storage on the network isn't controlled by any single company. Instead, ThreeFold facilitates open markets for storing files and running IT workloads in which anyone can participate in.

All networking within ThreeFold P2P Cloud is set up on a private overlay network and all 3Nodes come with their IPv6 addresses and are fully interconnected within the defined network securely. There is no TCP/IP traffic allowed from the outside, data is picked up from the inside, making it an incredibly secure and private environment to build IT workloads on. 

ThreeFold P2P Cloud uses autonomous technology to run IT workloads and a dispersed storage algorithm for storage. ThreeFold's Blockchain Database (BCDB) records all transactions within the network along with proofs from storage and compute nodes that the files are stored and run correctly. 

ThreeFold's infrastructure is totally autonomous. This means that there are no humans involved in the management of the infrastructure. Everything is managed by bots. Users access ThreeFold P2P Cloud via 3bots (virtual system administrators) that execute the commands (reservation of storage, running of containers, etc.) of the user on the operating system level of the 3Nodes. 

All transactions on the Threefold Grid are done via ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) - the official digital currency of the ThreeFold Grid, that represents a unit of storage, compute and network.

## For users 

Any file format can be stored on ThreeFold P2P Cloud and benefit from quantum-safe security at hyper competitive pricing. 

Users can define their storage environment trade-offs between cost, speed, redundancy by selecting the 3Nodes that best fits their needs. The ThreeFold Grid represents the largest peer-to-peer autonomous grid on the planet, and users can find storage capacity across 20+ countries. A dispersed storage algorithm is integrated to the P2P Cloud which permits users to split their data in shards and store them on different nodes. This data can only be assembled and displayed through the data owner's private key.

At any time, users can verify that their files are being stored correctly by looking at ThreeFold's Blockchain Database. 

## For developers

ThreeFold integrated Kubernetes to it's P2P Cloud solution to offer developers the most widely used container orchestration system in the world. Frameworks such as Helm Scripts were also integrated to very easily set-up and manage the execution of their containers and the interactions between them. 

Any Unix IT application can be deployed on Threefold P2P Cloud. It is fully compatible with industry standards such as Docker and major frameworks such as Grafana and Prometheus

This set-up enables developers from all around the world to benefit from a truly decentralized infrastructure while using the tools they already use on public clouds today.

Have a sneak preview of how you can run any of the millions of docker container images on the ThreeFold grid in [10 simple steps](https://forum.threefold.io/t/the-versatility-of-grid-2-8-launch-any-docker-container-image-in-the-world-on-tf-grid/1214)

And [here](https://vimeo.com/599371166/3311fbdadb) the video of doing the 10 steps.  Have fun!


## New to Peer-to-Peer ?

If you are new to ThreeFold and peer-to-peer systems, you're about to discover a new paradigm that will truly empower you to be sovereign and secure at all times. 

P2P is a movement within software development that will turn centralized and web3 into decentralized, secure and sustainable protocols that can scale infinitely. Instead of having a single point of control (like in public clouds) or replicating the data across many nodes (like in blockchain), applications and files built on P2P architectures remove the need from any intermediaries as well as replication of the data. Instead data is broken into shards (like puzzle pieces) and every shard is stored in a different server. This reduces the risk of censorship while also making it incredibly secure and sustainable. 

P2P is therefore a trustless infrastructure that allows users and developers to have real data ownership while reclaiming control over their data.

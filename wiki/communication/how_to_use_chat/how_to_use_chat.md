# How to Use Our Main Chat

Main Chat: https://t.me/threefold

Dear friends,

We love your feedback and we also feel we need to organize our chat better so that we can focus more on what needs to be done to move this beautiful project forward. üôè

A few things to share with you:

1. We want to be transparent, and we put much time into making everything open (look at the size of [our wikis](https://library.threefold.me/) and other repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation)).

2. We love input, and we do everything we can to honour the feedback we receive by incorporating it into everything we do.

3. We love when our community contributes, and today we have hundreds of people helping us across the board. It would be fantastic if you became a contributor on GitHub ([ThreeFold Tech](https://github.com/threefoldtech) or [ThreeFold Dubai](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation)), a moderator on [the ThreeFold Forum](https://forum.threefold.io/) or one of our groups, a [Grid Tester](https://t.me/threefoldtesting), a [Farmer](https://t.me/threefoldfarmers), etc.

- *Just get in touch with anyone from our team, and let's see how to best plug you in.*

4. We genuinely want to change anything that is not good enough. We are only human. Of course we have things to learn. We are a project that means well and wants to keep a positive energy flow.

5. We believe that TFT will do very well due to us creating a valuable and sustainable project ‚Äì and we do not believe in driving the token price up based on hype.

6. We want our public chat to grow of course, but to be as small as required and focused / to the point. Please use other mechanisms for communication and contribution where possible:

- Support chat on any of our websites (e.g. [threefold.io](https://threefold.io/)) for 1-1, and much more efficient.
- [ThreeFold Farmer Chat](https://t.me/threefoldfarmers) on Telegram for farmers and farming enthusiasts.
- [ThreeFold Grid Tester Community](https://t.me/threefoldtesting) on Telegram for early adopters and testers.
- [ThreeFold Forum](https://forum.threefold.io/) for all questions and suggestions ‚Äî best for meaningful conversations in an organized fashion.
- Our wikis ([main](threefold_home), [cloud](cloud_home) contain all our information. They are Github-based so that anyone can create pull requests for new information or suggested improvements. ([Main Wiki Github](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_threefold), [Cloud Wiki Github](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_cloud))

1. Don't use this chat to:

- Sell something directly or indirectly.
- Speculate about the token or usage of exchanges; we do not consider the token to be a product by itself.
- Lower the project's energy; if you don't like our project, we respect that; please respect us by leaving our chat and let us do our work.
- Ask for support questions; we created a webchat for that.

8. Please read our [code of conduct](https://forum.threefold.io/t/collaboration-manifesto-code-of-conduct/48) (and feel free to offer feedback)!

9. We believe that anonymity should not be needed in a group where people want to trust each other. Still we accept anonymity as long as it doesn't affect the level of trust which is essential to mantain the community together.

- If we feel that someone is potentially abusing their anonymous status, we will reach out to that person to find a better way forward.
- If the person refuses to be cooperative, we will block the person. We value all input, but we consider the chat to be like our home, and we want to know who is entering our home. Just like we are super open about anything we do and who we are, we only expect the same from our community.

10. We want to be a collaborative and inclusive group of friends that can learn from each other and improve our project together.

11. We thank you for all the questions we got over last weeks, we will prepare the following additional information:

- An execution plan for the next 6 months.
- Our position towards public exchanges and token hype
- Where do our energy savings come from
- How will we create a carbon neutral cloud?
- How do we compare to Dfinity and others?
- Improved Technology section on the wiki

Thank you for your support and your comments and feedback. We aim to learn from every one of you and generate additional info as required on our wiki or forum.

Regards and much love,

ThreeFold Team

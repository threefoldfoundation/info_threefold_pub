As one of its goals, the ThreeFold Dubai aims to provide fair and equal internet access / connectivity to everyone on earth. We are not alone in this vision, and as a foundation, we believe in collaboration rather than competition.

This summer, our very own rocket scientist ðŸš€ Weynand Kuijpers wrote two open letters to Elon Musk to explore how ThreeFold and Musk's Starlink program could join forces.

2. [Let's Create Internet Capacity Everywhere](https://medium.com/@kuijpersw/i-have-a-dream-ii-f3367bb3735e)

As Weynand states in his first post, "We love dreaming if it puts the planet first."

Enjoy! ðŸ’«

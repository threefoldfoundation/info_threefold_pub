# September 13: End User Solutions Coming

![](img/endusersolutions.jpeg)

Hello, hello!

We are currently working on more than 10 end-user solutions – including website and blog publishers, a decentralized video platform, & office tools – that can be deployed on the Grid.

We will maintain a demo format for now. Eventually, we'll include them in our own virtual system administrator "3Bot" to allow you to deploy them wherever you want.

Over the coming days, we'll provide some more information on these solutions. For now, we hope you're having a great weekend! ☀️

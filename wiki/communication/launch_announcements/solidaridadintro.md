Today we’re proud to introduce you to Solidaridad, a member of the Alliance for a Conscious Internet. In addition, Solidaridad is and has been a valued partner of ThreeFold Tech.

Solidaridad cares for smallholder farmers globally and works hard to create sustainable supply chains from the producer to consumers worldwide for a large number of commodities.

ThreeFold, Solidaridad, and other partners intend to build and interlink a think tank, a product lab, and three landscapes of change. You can read more about what that means in the first link below.

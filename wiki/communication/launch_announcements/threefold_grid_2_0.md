Founders Kristof De Spiegeleer, Adnan Fatayerji, Andreas Hartl, and Weynand Kuijpers formally announce the launch of the TF Grid 2.0 and the 3SDK (ThreeFold_Grid SDK) to the community! To provide helpful context, Kristof spends the first part of the announcement discussing the "why" behind what ThreeFold is building, alongside its many partners.

_For the past few years, we have been on a beautiful journey to build a new peer-to-peer internet that is better for humanity and better for our planet. ðŸŒŽ_

_Tonight, we are proud to launch the second generation of the ThreeFold_Grid, along with the ThreeFold_Grid Software Development Kit (the tool that gives anyone access to the Grid), and the ThreeFold Peer-to-Peer Cloud._

_It is a significant moment in our journey towards rolling out a new internet that adheres to the mission and values of the ThreeFold Dubai â€“ an internet founded on equality, autonomy, and sustainability â€“ and we thank our community for helping to get us to where we are today._

_Tonight is the beginning of a rolling launch of announcements over the coming weeks and months regarding the ThreeFold_Grid, many launching projects, use cases, new farmers, and of course the ThreeFold_Token (TFT)._

_A reminder: We are here for the planet first. This is our mission. We want to deliver a new network of internet capacity for all of us, owned by all of us. This is what we are doing. And this is what we will succeed in doing, together._

## The TFT is valuable

- Most amazing technology
  - see [Internet4 overview](internet4)
- The Use Cases 
	- cloud = a blue ocean (means +- unlimited demand)
	- digital twin, unlimited growth & possibilities
	- education platform to slow climate change
- We are not talk
	- all technology pieces are there and can be tested
	- we just lack adequate funding to make this global and huge
- Valuable
	- The value of the P2P global cloud we are building = many Billions
	- The value of our joint digital lives is unlimited: Trillions
- Tokenomics
	- Max nr of TFT tokens = 4 Billion.
	- The TFT is the exclusive medium to buy/sell required IT capacity for these use cases
	- The TFT marketcap will be <20m USD at launch, so clearly lots of room for growth

The TFGrid is the largest decentralised edge cloud in the world. There are 14,000 CPU cores and 80,000,000 GB storage available to be purchased on the TFGrid at this point. 

Once there are not enough TFT available (by design) the price of TFT should rise because each TFT represents future IT capacity and the internet represents a market of unlimited size ('blue ocean market').

# Circles and Organization

ThreeFold Foundation is organized in circles rather than a pyramid. Circle owners are responsible for ensuring the forward movement of their teams and the responsibilities of those teams. Circles are especially useful for decentralized working.

It is a completely open structure and anyone can participate.

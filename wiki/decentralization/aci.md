# Alliance Conscious Internet

> "Today the Internet seems to be a reliable source but don’t be mistaken. The Internet is very fragile. It's so centralized we can lose it at any time and there will be serious consequences e.g. blackouts.
> I can mention 100 reasons why, but please believe me for now, the Internet is a mess and will not stay intact under pressure."
> Kristof De Spiegieleer, Co-Founder of ThreeFold Tech & ThreeFold Foundation

ThreeFold Tech has built the open source technology behind the Grid of decentralized storage and compute capacity. The Grid is enabled by independent Farmers that connect hardware from all around the world. Anyone can easily become a Farmer, owning a piece of the new peer-to-peer Internet. The Conscious Internet should be owned by everyone.

The ThreeFold Foundation was formed with its sole purpose to serve, support and grow the Conscious Internet - experiences and solutions built on top of the ThreeFold_Grid.

For that, the ThreeFold Foundation created a digital currency, the ThreeFold_Token (TFT). TFT is a utility token representing a unit of reservation of that capacity, serving as a fair and trustworthy medium of exchange on the new peer-to-peer Internet.

The ThreeFold Foundation nurtured strong partnerships and formed the Alliance for a Conscious Internet to expand the Grid and grow experiences built on top of it.

If even 10% of humans today believe they can make a change the world is a better place tomorrow. Let's together enable humanity to do that.

## The Alliance for a Conscious Internet (ACI)

A collective ecosystem of planet and human centric projects co-creating a new conscious peer-to-peer Internet.

ACI aims to empower +1 Billion people with access to the Internet, allowing anyone to fairly exchange value, goods and information for less than $1 per month.

They do it by replacing competition with collaboration and choosing love over ego because they know that only together do we stand a chance to reach our goal.

They collaborate with one another to improve their solutions, efficiency, reach, visibility and service to the planet and humanity.

At this stage 20+ do-good for the planet projects have joined the Alliance for a Conscious Internet and pledged to migrate their solutions on the ThreeFold_Grid, supporting the movement of a new peer-to-peer Internet by allowing their solutions to become first use cases and experiences of Conscious Internet - the new decentralized digital world.

ThreeFold Dubai has adopted the Wisdom Council system as a resource model of harmonious decision making.

*Based upon ancient leadership practices and modern social science techniques as a way to consider all perspectives of the members in order to make decisions that are in the greatest interest of the mission and for the good of all.*

The Wisdom Council is composed of 9-12 members.

### Wisdom Council has following veto rights:

- Approve TFT donations (grants) to ThreeFold related contribution projects or doing good projects.
- Agree on changes in protocol or required data on TFChain e.g. [farming reward](farming_reward), [pricing](pricing) or [discount](staking_discount_levels) table.
- Approval of changes on knowledge base (wiki) whenever community or a ThreeFold organization requires this.

### Members

Wisdom Council Members are community leaders chosen by Founders Circle due to their honorable integrity and exemplary service related to The Mission. Structure and balance of Member Seats is based on one's personal role, strength, purpose, archetypes and other respectful characteristics.

We also call a Wisdom Council Member a ThreeFold Guardian.

## Remarks about Grants

ThreeFold Dubai receives through the blockchain a percentage of all Internet Capacity farmed and sold on the ThreeFold Grid. 

These proceeds are used to further develop the ThreeFold Movement and later to benefit planetary do-good projects.

Also a certain amount of TFT are available to use for the further development of the TFGrid.

- For Grid upto 2.x: The Wisdom Council members converge (online) to discuss and vote upon the distribution of funds from ThreeFold Dubai to pre-approved and/or pre-selected do-good projects and organizations.

## Future for 3.x

In the future our DAO will take over the wisdom council function.

## Remuneration

Not at this time.

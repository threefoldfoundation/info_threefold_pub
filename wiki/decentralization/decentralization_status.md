# Decentralization Status

We believe we are well under way to being a decentralized movement. ThreeFold has been designed to be decentralized – there are more than 500 independent active parties (ThreeFold Farmers) building the ThreeFold Grid today.

## Decentralized and available today

- ThreeFold_Token is already available on different blockchain ecosystems – Stellar, Binance Smartchain and Ethereum
- This provides for a secure and decentralized foundation for everyone. 
- ThreeFold_Token can be exchanged on Stellar DEX, Pancake Swap and other decentralized exchanges. See [here](https://manual.grid.tf/threefold_token/buy_sell_tft/buy_sell_tft.html).
- Independent farmers add Internet capacity to the ThreeFold Grid.
- All the Internet capacity is registered on TFChain and signed by the Farmer's 3Node.
- All the technology produced by ThreeFold is open source for everyone to see the progress, ask for feature requests, check/audit the code, etc on Github.
- There are many companies involved in the ecoystem, see [ThreeFold Companies](threefold_companies). 
- 3Nodes measure and verify the Internet capacity
- The uptime is measured by 3Nodes and registered in TFChain.
- Minting (creation of new ThreeFold_Token) is all done by means of code and validated by the TFGrid_Guardians.
- All the minting history is available on the blockchain as proof of capacity.
  - The hash is put in the transaction of the minting operation.
  - This means there is proof of every minting operation.
  - Also, [block0](genesis_block_pool_details) has been documented.
  - All minting reports are available and people with right tools can verify the minting reports vs the blockchain minting.
- TF Foundation & TF Tech use github to organize our work: 
    - https://github.com/orgs/threefoldtech/projects
    - https://github.com/orgs/threefoldfoundation/projects

## New in TFGrid 3.x

- Multiple Money blockchain: Stellar, Parity Substrate, Binance Smartchain, and Ethereum since Q3 2023
- Money & consensus separated blockchain
- TF Grid data objects are stored on Parity/Substrate-based decentralized blockchain database (phonebook, tfdirectory)
- Every farmer works with TFChain to register farm.
- Every grid user works with TFChain to register identity (uses TFConnect as tool).
- All billing is done through TFChain.
- All farming rewards are calculated through TFChain.
- The governance for important decisions is done through TFChain = TFDAO, and the forum is used to coordinate.

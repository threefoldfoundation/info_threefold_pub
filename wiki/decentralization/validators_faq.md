# Frequently Asked Questions For ThreeFold Validators

> We announced our validator program in 2022, it is still not active and needs to happen. Quite some people have bought tokens and have shown interest to run a validator. Please join us in the forums, we are discussing how to release the validators and update some of the specs to be in line with what we learned over the last year.   

#### What are Validators?

A blockchain validator participates in **“consensus”** and **maintains** the record of **transactions**. Once transactions are verified. Validators are computers that maintain the blockchain's **integrity** by keeping a record of the whole transaction history, from the first block to the last. 


#### Why are Validators important for ThreeFold?

Validators are an essential part of the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. They are essentially the moderators of the staking system and have the extremely important **responsibility** of authoring new blocks on the chain. To have the **most decentralized** system possible, ThreeFold needs a good number of validator nodes that can be elected. That’s the primary reason why we limited the amount of validators one person or entity can hold to 1.

This creates the greatest variety of staking options for the community and also **protects** the system by preventing the chain from being controlled by one very wealthy individual. When there are more people validating the blockchain, it significantly increases the barrier to being elected and allows for a **fairer ecosystem** to emerge.

#### Can anyone run a validator node?

Validator nodes can be run **by anyone** with hardware that meets the minimum requirements . Once the blockchain is set up on the hardware, all the verifications and voting is done on a web portal, a **seamless** process accessible to anyone. However, it is **important to remember** that if a validator fails to uphold their responsibilities, a portion of their stake will be slashed (fined), as such an event would impact the resilience and security of the network. 

The **responsibility** of a validator (owner) can be summarized to:

* **Actively** participating in the governance of the network the validator protects
* Validator owners are expected to be **active members** of the community and must always be up-to-date with the current state of the ecosystem, so that they can easily adapt to any changes.

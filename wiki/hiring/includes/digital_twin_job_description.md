Together we will be creating the future of our digital life, we need to design/implement a new back-end layer for our digital life.

Our Digital Twin already is an alternative to:

- Whatsapp
- Dropbox
- Zoom
- and we are adding many more experiences..

As a protocol.me engineer we need you to define/implement the protocol used by all those experiences, that will allow any developer globally to expand the Digital Twin.

- Work with Vlang, JavaScript, Node.js, Blockchain layer
- Work in our international development team
- We are not just looking for an engineer we are looking for people who believe that the world needs a new internet, so we make it happen.

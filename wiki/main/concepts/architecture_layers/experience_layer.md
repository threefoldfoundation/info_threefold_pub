## Experience Layer

This layer is where the human imagination comes into play. 

It is where users can access different sets of experiences (social, office, productivity, finances, and more) and where creators can build new experiences. 

This is the layer that best represents the current user experience with today’s Internet – the applications and services we interact with. 

The approach of ThreeFold's ecosystem is value-based and puts humanity and the planet at the center of everything they do - the possibilities are now endless. Switch from an app-centric to a human-centric digital world. ThreeFold does not develop these components but relies on the ecosystem and partners to do so.

What do we mean by this? From many profiles scattered across many applications, to a single identity that connects with all your digital experiences. 

ThreeFold's ecosystem objective is to enable a true peer-to-peer digital world where you always remain at the center of your digital life - reducing redundancy and improving your user experience.

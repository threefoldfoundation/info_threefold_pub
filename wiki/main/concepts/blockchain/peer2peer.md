# Peer To Peer

Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes.

Peers make a portion of their resources, such as processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth, directly available to other network participants, without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts.[1] Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the traditional client–server model in which the consumption and supply of resources is divided.

At ThreeFold we believe that Peer2Peer is often more efficient compared to a classic blockchain.

This has nothing to do with illegal filesharing, this is the concept where parties communicate to each other in the most efficient direct way possible.

Its the purest form of decentralization.

Its a very overlooked concept in the IT industry.

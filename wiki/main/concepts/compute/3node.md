# 3Node

![](img/tf_grid.png)

Computers (servers) are the low-level provider for the IT capacity of the Cloud, we call them TFGrid Nodes or in short a `3Node`.

ZeroOS = [ZOS](tfgrid:zos) is the operating system which allows the 3Nodes to be used to provide IT capacity required by the solutions running on the TFGrid.

They provide storage, compute & networking capacities. Together, 3Nodes make up the capacity layers for the TF Grid.

Today we have about thousands of 3Nodes across the grid see our https://explorer.grid.tf

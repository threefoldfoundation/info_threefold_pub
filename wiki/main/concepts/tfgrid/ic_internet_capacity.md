# Cloud Capacity

IC = Internet Capacity, everything which drives our digital life. In an enterprise it's called IT (Information Technology) systems.

Internet Capacity is resource availability for running any IT workload:

- Storage
- Compute
- Networking

Examples of IT workloads which can run on the ThreeFold_Grid are:

- web applications
- archiving of data
- generic storage (e.g. using the S3 storage interface)
- container workloads (e.g. Docker images)
- artificial intelligence workloads
- big data workloads (processing of data)
- gaming servers
- content delivery
- test workloads for developers
- Dapps (e.g. OpenPages)

## More Info

ThreeFold Capacity can exist everywhere – in peoples' homes, in mobile telephone masts, in utility cabinets, next to railways or motorways, anywhere where internet lines meet electrical outlets. 

This capacity is deployed to the TF Grid and has no people involved to manage its operations (apart from the physical and network aspects). Farmers have no access to the TFNodes purchased. 

They can only use the capacity produced in the exact same way as any other user, i.e. through the TF Chain, in a secure private and neutral way, equally applicable to all.

ThreeFold capacity provides the following 3 basic services:

- Storage Capacity = backend storage services which can be used as backend for more high level storage services like S3
- Compute Capacity = backend compute capacity which can be used as backend for more high level compute services like Kubernetes
- Network Gateway Services: integration with ZeroTier network, HTTP(s) reverse proxy, DNS services, TCP Port Forwarding

These basic services are ordered through the TF Chain only. SLA's (service level agreements) cannot be guaranteed on Unmanaged Capacity and as such not registered in the TF Chain.

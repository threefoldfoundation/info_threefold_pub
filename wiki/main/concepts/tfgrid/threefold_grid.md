# ThreeFold_Grid

ThreeFold_Grid is a global, neutral, and sustainable network of autonomous storage and compute Internet capacity created by ThreeFold Farmers, with more than 80,000,000 GB and 20,000 cores existing today. On this Grid, IT capacity is indexed / registered on the TF Chain for easy discovery by purchasers. Any application which can run on Linux can run on the ThreeFold_Grid but with more privacy, security, closer to the end-user, and at a much lower cost.

This Internet capacity is produced and allocated locally - similar to the way electricity and other utilities are purchased today. This allows any digital service or application provider to host their services and applications in proximity to the end user leading to significantly greater performance, a lower price point and better margins. This is both more cost effective and green.

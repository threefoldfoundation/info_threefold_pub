# ThreeFold Technology Council

![](img/technology_council.png)

Technology Guardians are the members of the ThreeFold Technology Council.

## Mission

Together, they make the required day-to-day technology decisions for the ThreeFold_Grid, evaluating to the best of their abilities the technology that needs to be deployed.

Some examples of decisions which need to be taken:

- Approve code releases
- Sign the deployment of the code, so no code can be deployed for production purposes before majority signs
- Approve new development projects when funded by the ThreeFold Foundation
- Approve standards and procedures that could be relevant for the TF Grid technology stack or operations

## Council

They don’t take being a member of this council lightly, it's a serious responsibility.

## Fit for duty requirements

- We *really* believe that what is being developed for the ThreeFold_Grid is super important for the planet in an attempt to help raise awareness (consciousness), but in this case for the digital world (Internet). We don’t look at this like some technical gimmick, but rather a real necessity.
- There is no ego involved by being a guardian.
  - We realize our own reason to be a guardian is to be at the service of the ThreeFold community and the planet.
- We work on self-development
  - We realize we know nothing and are nothing but will always work in the best interest of the planet. The more we learn, the less we know.
  - We don’t blame others – change starts with ourselves.
  - We see the benefit of self-improvement work (e.g. meditation, self-reflection, sessions with energy healers or spiritual coaches, etc.)
- We are not addicted to any substance.
- We really believe the values as described on our [FreeFlow Nation](https://freeflownation.org/).
  - We know them, we understand them, we agree with them.
- If we have a shortcoming in one of the above, we are not afraid to be open about it and express our desire to improve on it.
- Technical
  - We are experts for at least 50% of the code as used in the TF Grid.
  - We are not shy to read code.
  - We have a deep understanding of how it all works.
- We are willing to be a Technology Guardian for at least 2 years starting from our submission.

## Our character

We will do everything we can to protect the technical sanity of the ThreeFold_Grid core technologies.

We evaluate based on:

- Security
- Scalability
- Decentralization
- Sustainability

## Remuneration

Not at this time.

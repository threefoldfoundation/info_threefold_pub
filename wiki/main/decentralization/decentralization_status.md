# Decentralization Status

We believe we are well under way to being a decentralized movement. ThreeFold has been designed to be decentralized – there are more than 100 independent active parties (ThreeFold Farmers) building the ThreeFold Grid today.

## Decentralized and available today

- The ThreeFold Token (TFT) is on a public blockchain – in this case, Stellar, Binance Smartchain and future even others like Kosmos.
- This provides very good security and decentralization for everyone.
- The TFT can be exchanged on Stellar decentralized exchange and other decentralized exchanges. See [here](how_to_buy).
- Independent farmers add capacity to the ThreeFold Grid.
- All capacity is registered on TFChain and signed by the Farmer 3Node.
- All technology is open source and everyone can see progress, ask for feature requests, check/audit the code, etc – via Github.
- There are many companies involved see [ThreeFold Companies](threefold_companies).
- Measurement of capacity is done per 3Node.
- Measurement of uptime is done per 3Node and registered in blockchain.
- Minting (creation of new tokens) is all done by means of code and validated by the TFGrid_Guardians for TFGrid 2.x, from 3.2 it should be function of the TFDAO.
- Every minting operation since the start of the blockchain creates a proof document.
  - The hash is put in the transaction of the minting operation.
  - This means there is proof of every minting operation.
  - Also, [block0](genesis_block_pool_details) has been documented.
  - From TFGrid 3.x proof of capacity is registered in TFChain
- TF Foundation & TF Tech use a priority management tool to let everyone have input on priorities and manage work well (see [circles.threefold.me](https://circles.threefold.me)).

## New in TFGrid 3.x

- Multiple Money blockchain: Stellar, Parity Substrate, Binance Smartchain
- Money & consensus separated blockchain
- TF Grid data objects are stored on Parity/Substrate-based decentralized blockchain database (phonebook, tfdirectory)
- Every farmer works with TFChain to register farm.
- Every grid user works with TFChain to register identity (uses TFConnect as tool).
- All billing is done through TFChain.
- All farming rewards are calculated through TFChain (starting 3.1)
- All governance is done through TFChain (starting 3.2)

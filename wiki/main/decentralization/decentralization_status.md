# Decentralization Status

We believe we are well under way to being a decentralized movement. ThreeFold has been designed to be decentralized – there are more than 100 independent active parties (ThreeFold Farmers) building the ThreeFold Grid today.

## Decentralized and available today

- The ThreeFold Token (TFT) is on a public blockchain – in this case, Stellar.
- This provides very good security and decentralization for everyone.
- The TFT can be exchanged on Stellar decentralized exchange and other decentralized exchanges. See [here](how_to_buy).
- Independent farmers add capacity to the ThreeFold Grid.
- All capacity is registered on TFDirectory (our [TFExplorer](https://explorer.threefold.io)) and signed by the Farmer 3Node.
- All technology is open source and everyone can see progress, ask for feature requests, check/audit the code, etc – via Github.
- TF Grid IT workloads are distributed using the Smart Contract for IT (multi-signature capability).
- TF Foundation is for promotion only (Mazraa, which is a sub-brand, is also a farmer).
- Measurement of capacity is done per 3Node.
- Measurement of uptime is done per 3Node and distributed.
- Minting (creation of new tokens) is all done by means of code and validated by the TFGrid_Guardians.
- Every minting operation since the start of the blockchain creates a proof document.
  - The hash is put in the transaction of the minting operation.
  - This means there is proof of every minting operation.
  - Also, [block0](genesis_block_pool_details) has been documented.
- A multi-signature wallet exists for rewarding people gifted TFT for contributions made to the project.
- TF Foundation & TF Tech use a priority management tool to let everyone have input on priorities and manage work well (see [circles.threefold.me](https://circles.threefold.me)).
- Our council structure – see [Threefold Councils](threefold_councils) – is like a human blockchain and protects the values of ThreeFold.

## New decentralization planned for H2 2021

- As part of our TF Grid 3.0, we have new exciting blockchain capabilities
  - Multiple blockchain: Stellar, Parity Substrate.
  - Money & consensus separated blockchain
  - See [TFGrid 3.0 Consensus Mechanism Specifications](consensus3) (technical).
  - TF Grid data objects are stored on Parity/Substrate-based decentralized blockchain database (phonebook, tfdirectory)
- Again, ThreeFold has been designed to be decentralized – many farmers together provide the infrastructure for the new Internet built by everyone for everyone. We are now preparing for the next phase:
  - We want to create 2-3 legal global structures in which we can accept funding and get approval from the government for the structure and token
    - This will have an impact on how to organize our Foundation
    - Restructuring will be done done in Belgium, Dubai, & Switzerland
    - As part of our ThreeFold_30 launch, we hope to be able to sell some Foundation TFT, which can fund these operations.

## Perception

- We can always improve on perception
  - Some people perceive the foundation as too centralized
  - The foundation is only a promotion vehicle
  - We need to make sure everyone understands this and sees how we reach out to the community for advice and support
  - Some people have multiple hats on (e.g. Kristof works for TF Foundation and for TF Tech)
    - We believe there is no conflict of interest today because the "interest" between TF Tech and TF Foundation is 100% aligned
  - We need to be more vocal about the fact that we are a community
    - It's not just some people dictating direction
    - Among other strategies, we use our own priority management tool to coordinate on decisions (again, see [circles.threefold.me](https://circles.threefold.me))

## Remark: We believe in the good of people and relying on "human blockchains"

This is why we have implemented our [council structure](threefold_councils).

- We are using code (software) to do all the minting (creation of tokens)
- In v2.0 we still use a "human blockchain" to validate the minting operation (validation of the minting)
- The code used in this process is open source and can be found in the code repos
- We found out that this actually a requirement for the possibility to become a licensed token/digital currency in certain regions

> DISCLAIMER: the checks (validation of transactions) as done by any of our Councils or community members do not imply any guarantee or impose any liabilities on ThreeFold Foundation of any of the related parties.

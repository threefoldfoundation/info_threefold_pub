# Digibyte Foundation

![](img/digibyte.png)

_The Digibyte Foundation_ is here to empower a sustainable decentralized world. We aim to stimulate global adoption of our blockchain and similar technologies that fulfil the core principles of decentralization in general. Decentralization needs to happen to see a better redistribution of opportunities, growth and value within our global society.

### Purpose

Thousands of volunteers from all over the world have contributed to DigiByte in countless ways for years to make it what it is today. DigiByte is a collective movement to protect and promote the true principles of decentralization and empower communities to establish and maintain a sustainable decentralized world. The DigiByte Foundation aims to initiate and promote projects and community initiatives, but also promote the DigiByte ecosystem and further development by supporting creators, developers and marketers, with a focus on outreach, awareness, education, adoption.

# DigitalTwin Office

![](img/digitalyouoffice.png)

To enable DigitalTwin Office, we integrated with [onlyoffice](https://www.onlyoffice.com/) for this, which is in our opinion the best made office solution that gets close the above cited criteria. Only Office is open-source (which we use today) but we also want to make a license deal with them to cater for support and allow even enterprises to use this on a larger scale. 

### Purpose

The purpose of DigitalTwin Office is to deliver an online office environment that is 100% integrated with your Cryatal Twin only 100% private to you. Millions of people are looking for a neutral office solution which is:
- neutral

- faster, simple to use
- cost-effective
- able to work everywhere
- has advanced features like real time collaboration

### Status Today

# Project: Grid Enhancements

![](img/cap2layer.png)

### Purpose

The TF Grid v2.0 is being rolled out and we see a lot of features that we would love to roll out and bring to market.  

One of the very obvious one is that we see that the original vision to roll out [Zero-OS](https://github.com/threefoldtech/zos) was to use the new (inter)networking standard IPv6.  During the migration of the grid from version 1.0 to 2.0 we learned that IPv6 is not readily available everywhere and this is a limiting factor in terms of how and where the TF Grid can grow.

We expect to learn a lot from deploying the TF Grid in different parts of the world, for different kinds of farmers and for different specific use cases.  We want to implement those learning and necessary conditions to support the maximum growth potential for this grid (to reach the mission: "1 Billion users using the grid for **all** their digital needs by 2030).

To do this we need to have a group of engineers who can deliver on this ever changing technology landscape and inspire a group of contributing engineers in the community to make this open source project go forward.

The feature requests are open for anyone to add and input to. The feature request list for grid enhancements is managed in GitHub:

### Goal

Provide funds to deliver on the necessary conditions to expand the grid everywhere and provide all features required.

### Funding

- Required funding to finish roadmap as described below / above in the feature request list: 10,000,000 TFT

### Team

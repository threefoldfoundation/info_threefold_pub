*The Money of Good* is a socioeconomic platform that uses disruptive proof-of-meditation technology (neurofeedback+blockchain) to offer people the chance to earn money as a reward for practicing meditation, improving their health, raising consciousness while fostering a new fair and sustainable economic model.

### Purpose

The main direct impacts are the rise of global consciousness and the birth of a new regenerative and conscious economic model. The sub impacts are the improvement of global health, the empowerment of individuals economically by minimizing inequality, and the leverage of sustainable local businesses.

# Artheon VR Museum

![](img/artheon_.jpg)

*The Artheon VR Museum* is and always will be a free educational platform offering immersive, next level interaction with objects of cultural heritage.

### Purpose

Art is one of the most important tools to inspire faith and cultural growth giving a new perspective of looking at reality. We believe that free global access to fine art and culture is a prerequisite for the development of human kind. Our vision is to provide a one stop full spectrum art education platform to access, learn and share knowledge in art and culture from across the globe.

### Status Today

Artheon VR Museum to day has a database of 400,000+ artworks from across the globe that can be experienced both in VR and desktop. Artheon is growing into a crowd-sourced global art database empowering smaller museums, private collections, galleries and individuals with tools to publish and display artwork and provide courses, tours, lectures, events, around art culture and history.

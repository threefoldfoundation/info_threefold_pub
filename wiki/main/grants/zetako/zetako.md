# Zetako

*The Zetako* has built the technology that provides 30% more compression and speed, and uses 70% less energy in the process. In addition to this, the technology is capable of doing bit-by-bit compression allowing for real time bandwidth reduction - the technology does NOT need a prior knowledge of the dataset to start compression. In layman terms, this means that our technology does not require the data stream to be chopped up into chunks - we apply compression the moment the first bit (1 or 0) comes in.

### Purpose

We are creating, storing, and sending more data than ever before, and this trend will certainly continue as more people come online and with trends such as the Internet of Things and 5G, as examples. More data means more energy consumption, which is not good for our planet.
We are in a position to become the standard of lossless data compression for the next decades that will provide a solution to the problem of every growing amount of data and the energy used to transport and store it.

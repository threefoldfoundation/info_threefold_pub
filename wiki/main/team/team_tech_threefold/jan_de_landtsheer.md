At Play. Jan used to be a true daredevil. If he wasn’t driving his 1200 cc Ducati he would be climbing rock faces all over Europe. Although he still enjoys looking at these things he now chooses a more relaxing lifestyle. Cuddling his 14 kilogram cats, hanging out in his sauna, and practicing nerdy mindfulness by figuring out how to embed Rust code on tiny circuit boards.

We call Jan our walking encyclopedia.

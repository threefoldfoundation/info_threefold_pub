# ThreeFold Project History

This document has as a purpose to provide some overview of the history of ThreeFold. We are now quite some years into the project.

We are a decentralized movement, ThreeFold Foundation has the purpose to promote the ThreeFold_Grid and movement. 

The Foundation wants to operate as a not for profit organization. Not for profit means that no shareholder has the intent to ever use any of the benefits (if any) as created in ThreeFold Foundation.

## History

In the earlier days of ThreeFold, there were multiple teams collaborating – but the two core teams were located in Dubai and Belgium.

- In Dubai we had [ThreeFold_Dubai](threefold_dubai) = ThreeFold Foundation (\*) – this company was owned by Adnan Fatayerji & Kristof de Spiegeleer
- In Belgium we had [BetterToken](bettertoken) – this company was owned by Kristof and Kristof's Incubator (Incubaid)

Adnan & Kristof started the ThreeFold idea (which is basically just a concept people can relate to or not) from the above-mentioned companies and have always acted in their respective capacity as directors of these companies. This structure would later evolve into the ThreeFold Foundation as it is known today.

A small part of the original funding came from the fact that The ThreeFold Foundation has sold early capacity in form of ThreeFold Tokens. 

These buyers could use their TFT to buy IT capacity from ThreeFold_Dubai or BetterToken BV until April 2020, or from the TF Grid directly in a fully decentralized way starting May 2020.

The ThreeFold_Grid is the result of many farmers using the open source technology which is now on https://github.com/threefoldtech.

Originally, the technology used was created by three companies: GreenIT Globe, ThreeFold_Dubai & [ThreeFold Tech](tftech). The last two still actively participate in the creation of tech components or content as used by all ThreeFold Farmers today.

## Status (Aug 2020)

TF Foundation is investigating to create a legal funding structure in potentially multiple jurisdictions to be able to fundraise for the foundation and have government support for our token. 

In such a structure investors can provide funding for promoting capacity in the region, manage the digital currency, organize token funding/resell events, etc. 

We are in conversations with multiple regions which are friendly towards digital currency or crypto projects.

## Genesis Pool

To kickstart the ThreeFold_Grid back in 2017 the foundation committed large amounts of capacity to the grid. This was called the [Genesis Pool](genesis_pool) and the tokens sold as mentioned could be used to use capacity from this pool and more.

See [here for more info about Genesis Pool](genesis_pool).

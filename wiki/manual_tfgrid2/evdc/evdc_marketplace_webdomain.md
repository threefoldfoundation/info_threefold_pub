# Deploy a solution under your web domain

A solution can be deployed under an auto-generated URL or can be linked to your own domain. 

## How to link a marketplace solution to your domain? 

Throughout the chat flow, you will be asked to select a subdomain. Select the option `Choose a custom subdomain` to publish your solution to your domain.

Now, you need to link the domain name to the IP address reserved with your VDC. To do so, first copy the IP address.

# Wireless Community Networks
**Research on global mesh community**

This movement shares the same goals as ThreeFold Foundation which makes it a perfect partner.

## What is it all about?
Wireless community networks (WCNs) or wireless community projects are organizations that take a grassroots approach to providing a viable alternative to municipal wireless networks for consumers.[1]

Many of these organizations set up wireless mesh networks which rely primarily on sharing of unmetered residential and business DSL and cable Internet. This sort of usage might be non-compliant with the terms of service of local internet service providers (ISPs) that deliver their service via the consumer phone and cable deploy. Wireless community networks sometimes advocate complete freedom from censorship, and this position may be at odds with the acceptable use policies of some commercial services used. Some ISPs do allow sharing or reselling of bandwidth.[2]

# Ansible

With the exponential growth of IT industries around the globe, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to manually keep track of all development tasks. Automation adds efficiency to your company allowing your developers to concentrate their efforts where it matters the most.

## What is Ansible?

Ansible is an automation tool created for the sole purpose of handling redundant that would otherwise slow down your development cycle. The automation tool is used in IT services such as application deployment, management, provisioning, and inter service orchestration. In times of quickly scaling IT industries and their ever-increasing complexity of work, Ansible is like Moses created to shepherd the hapless sheep of through the valley of IT development.

Ansible is now owned by RedHat.

## Ansible offers the following advantages:

- Since Ansible is an open-source tool, it’s completely free.
- Its powerful infrastructure allows you to carve out highly complex workflows with relative ease.
- You don’t need hacker level coding experience to use Ansible playbooks. They are easy to learn and relatively easier to operate.
- It's flexible in its use, letting you customize it from anywhere you want.
- You don’t have to install any extra software which gives you all the room you want for your application and other resources on the server.
- You don’t need any management structure, no firewalls, client systems, or anything else. Ansible handles everything there is to the automation process.

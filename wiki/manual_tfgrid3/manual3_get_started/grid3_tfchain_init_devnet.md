## TF-Chain on Devnet

!!!include grid3_portal_notice

For deployments, you'll need a TF-Chain account and a twin registered. You'll need both your mnemonic phrase and TwinID to pass to the Terraform plugin.

#### Important notes:

- You must choose `ed25519` as the "crypto type" when setting up your account
- When funding your wallet from the provided faucet accounts, you can transfer more than the shown balance of those accounts. Take a few thousand tokens to make sure you don't run out while testing
- The guide advises to find your twin ID by checking the `twinID()` method. However, this will only correspond to your ID until a new twin is created and the value is incremented. To make sure you're seeing the ID associated with your account, use `twinIdByAccountID(AccountId)` instead, and select your account name from the drop down.

# Testing The ThreeFold_Grid3

After each release of every newer grid version, we invite everyone within ThreeFold Community to test the grid's product components and give our engineering team constructive feedback on our product development.

# Strategy
#### we have two ways for testing our product:
##### 1- Automation testing
This done by our internal QA team, Automating most of the test scenarios and run them in a nightly build to know the status of our code and early catch functionality and regression issues.
##### 2- Manual testing
This done by our QA tea with the help of the grid testing community.

We have chosen to use [TestLodge](grid3_testlodge) as our QA and testing platform. Testlodge is a platform that enable ThreeFold to manage our products' test plans, test cases & test runs with ease. By joining TestLodge as a user, you could then assist us in running test use cases and reporting issues found during our product deployment processes.
Please enter the issues you discover in the Circles tool in project [TFGrid 3.0 Testing](https://circles.threefold.me/project/test-tfgrid3/issues).

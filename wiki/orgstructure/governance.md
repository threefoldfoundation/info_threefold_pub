!!!include:threefold_history_include

> Some people have claimed that some threefold founders sold tokens and dumped the price, this is not true and can be verified using our blockchain. The ThreeFold founders have invested millions of USD in the project so far, they did not take money out. Lots of our team work on reduced salary some even without.

## FAQ

### Did ThreeFold do a ICO

We never launched tokens by means of an ICO. At start there was a pre-sale of capacity for a cloud which was operational in the form of TFT. 

We never organized a pump and dump or any other synthetic mechanism to boost the token price and benefit.

We believe in organic growth.

### Did the founders dump tokens

No, see above. As a group we have invested more than 10m USD in cash and time, we did not use the tokens we might own as a mechanism to make benefit.

### The token price is so low.

Indeed, we share your sentiments and are equally disheartened by the situation. Two years ago, we secured a deal valued at 5m USD. Regrettably, the project defaulted on their payment obligations, leading to a significant cash flow disruption that has persisted for the past 1.5 years. However, there's a silver lining: we are on the cusp of resolving this financial challenge. Currently, we are in the concluding stages of a fundraising effort with our venture creator, who intends to invest 7.5m USD into the ThreeFold project.

### The originally farmed tokens = genesis pool is large

See our [genesis pool](genesis_pool) overview for more info.

The pool was real hardware in Dubai and Ghent.

The tokens out of this pool are safe and well managed, we are acquiring a lot of them in ThreeFold Cloud.

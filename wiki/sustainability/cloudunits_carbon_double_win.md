# ThreeFold Grid is 2x carbon negative.

> 3x more energy is offset compared to what the grid uses.


## process

### carbon farming

- students execute carbon farming projects
  - climate action plans see TAG
- measurement of impact using the Digital Twin
- student gets carbon credits (which are stored on a blockchain)
- student can convert carbon credits to TFT when they want, are vested TFT.
- student can use these TFT to buy internet capacity or access to education or any other planet positive internet related action

### offseting of energy usage of grid

- tfchain knows kg CO2 produced per country per kwh
  - at start we take average of 0.4 kgh CO2 per kwh
- tfchain knows amount of CU & SU which are farmed per month and per country.
- this allows tfchain to calculate the amount of CO2  which needs to be offset (per month).
- threefold uses TFT to buy Carbon credits (see above)
  - if not enough carbon credits by students then we buy it from other carbon credit marketplaces
- TFChain offsets 3x more than what is used.

## Calculator

Next calculation shows how many TFT we have to compensate and give to students as part of TAG program to make our cloud remove 2x more carbon than it produces.

# Sustainable technology

There’s no question that climate change is one of the biggest, if not the biggest threats facing humanity today. If we care at all about future generations and the health of our planet we have no choice but to address these threats and fast. ThreeFold is taking not just a sustainable approach, we’re setting the plan for a planet-positive internet. 

ThreeFold reworked the whole approach to IT architectures and eliminated the layers of complexity. The result is a cloud stack that presents minimal overhead and that requires less hardware - reducing heat generation and eventually cooling requirements. By reducing the need for power, the net result is an energy-efficient Internet Grid. 

The algorithm of Zero-OS, ThreeFold Operating Software, maximizes utilization possibilities which enables greeter performance and sustainability. Moreover, it uses minimal Linux Kernel that allows for a number of user spaces to co-exist. In these user spaces, containerized versions of software can be run, eliminating the need for hypervisors, virtual OS to fuel the virtual machines, and guest operating systems. 

# Carbon-Negative Grid 

The ThreeFold Grid (“Grid”)  is planning to become a carbon-negative Grid by end of 2022. Farmers who provide internet capacity by connecting 3Nodes on the Grid will contribute to offset their carbon emission 3 times. This will be undertaken along with our Climate Education Partner to create a Voluntary Carbon Offset System. 

Farmers will contribute, directly from their Farming Reward for their carbon emission. The amount of ThreeFold Token allocated depends on the type of 3node (as each type of 3nodes has a different power utilization) and the country where the 3node is located (as each country has a different electricity production structure). Other variables will be taken into consideration to ensure the reliability of the carbon offset. The ThreeFold Token will be reallocated to a pool dedicated for the carbon offset.

The process will be undertaken in two rounds. The first round (timeline = 1 year)  will be dedicated to offsetting a lifetime carbon emission (3 times) through tree planting - Please note, depending on the type of trees,  on average a tree absorbs approximately 28 kg of carbon per year The required amount of trees will be planted by students and teachers from different locations of the world - This process will be audited by community members. The type of tree will be studied in order to plant species that are in harmony with the current environment biodiversity. The first round is to create the foundation of the carbon-negative grid. 

Then the second round (starting from the end of Round 1) will be used to enhance the life of local communities by providing education and community funding, monetary help in building schools, renewable energy, waste management, internet access, etc.

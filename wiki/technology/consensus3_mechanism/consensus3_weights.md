## weights for multisignature

We define a logical set of weights to make sure that no party can transfer money unless all conditions are achieved.

### for vesting & locking

- a person account = weight of 5
- 9 signers have weight of 1
- signing weight in total needs to be 10

This means a person holding TFT can not transfer money out unless Consensus engine has signed as well.
This means consensus engine cannot send money out unless person agrees.

## for Farming Rewards (minting)

- ThreeFold asks for the transaction = weight of 5
- 9 signers have weight of 1
- signing weight in total needs to be 10
- the signers are the Guardians of ThreeFold.

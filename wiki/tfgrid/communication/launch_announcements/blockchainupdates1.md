# June 9: Update on Recent Blockchain Partnerships

We are working towards the deployment of projects' nodes on the ThreeFold_Grid and have specifically been focusing on the two-click node deployment process as well as improvements to our SDK.

The feedback overall has been positive and helpful in this early stage. Many thanks to the teams at each of these projects for their collaboration. 🙏

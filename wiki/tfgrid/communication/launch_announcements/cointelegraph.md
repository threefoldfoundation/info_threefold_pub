# June 4: Coverage on Cointelegraph

![](img/cointelegraph.png)

We received some coverage in Cointelegraph yesterday pertaining to our project and our partnership with DigiByte and others.

It's a good read, it was honest, and it presented some questions. (By the way, there's a forum conversation going on to answer those questions.)

We invite you to take a read of both the article and the forum conversation – and please feel free to get involved in the forum if you have ANY questions about our project.

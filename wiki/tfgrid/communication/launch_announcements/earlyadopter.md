All,

We've gotten very good initial feedback on our TF Grid 2.2 release, which has many exciting new features. If you'd like to be one of our Testers / Early Adopters, please join us in [this Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/BwOvOxxgK59GmRoZ2_sM0w). We will be looking forward to your feedback.

The work in progress manual for the new release can be found on https://manual2.threefold.io/.

Next week we aim to host one or more 'Getting Started' Zoom sessions. For more information, we invite you to join the Telegram group mentioned above.

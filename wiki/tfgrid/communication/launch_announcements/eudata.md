*Join representatives of the EU institutions, member states, businesses and other experts for a discussion on the roadmap to build a successful European Cloud Federation. As Germany and France present GAIA-X – a proposal for a decentralised cloud infrastructure – and as the European Commission prepares the follow-up to its Data Strategy, Forum Europe & HPE are pleased to host this discussion on the policies, business models and investments needed to design the blueprint for Europe’s future data economy infrastructure.

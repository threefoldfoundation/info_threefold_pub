# February 10: An Update on Grid 2.4, 2.5, & 3.0!

![](img/grid242530update.png)

Our TF Grid 2.4 has now been on testnet for over a month and we are getting good test results – but we need more! We need more [people who want to test](https://t.me/joinchat/BwOvOxxgK59GmRoZ2_sM0w), and we need more farmers who are willing to upgrade to the 2.4 (soon 2.5) release and make additional capacity available towards the community.

We are maintaining our test cases using a tool called [TestLodge](https://www.testlodge.com/). Anyone who is interested to contribute in writing tests or executing on tests is more than welcome – the more exposure we get, the faster our TF Grid will be usable for a more general audience! Please contact us on our website chat or send a note to weynand@threefold.io!

Some of the 2.4 features ready to play with:

- Marketplace with +10 solutions ready to be installed with some clicks
- Full Kubernetes support – deploy anything you want using tools people love
- First version of our Planetary Filesystem (mount a filesystem everywhere and write to the TF Grid in a way data can never be lost, with full - security/privacy and sovereignty)

Find Grid 2.4 release notes [here](cloud:release_notes_2_4_0).

We are almost ready with for our 2.5 release with the following new features:

- Farmers can specify their own pricing
- Backup feature for your configuration information of your eVDC
- Much more documentation (at this point documentation is not good)
- Many more farmers (please contact us to contribute capacity)
- Single sign on for the apps on the marketplace
- Ansible support for Infrastructure as Code movement (this is huge)

In parallel, we are working on our next major release (3.0) which doesn't have many end user-visible changes but is more focused on some longer term architectural changes (billing & provisioning related) needed for even more scale & community integration. Expected < 2 months. Some things to look forward to:

- New billing flows, no more need to make reservations. All becomes pay as you go, is much easier. Unique in the blockchain space!
- Integration of the payment flows with the first version of our Digital Twin
- We introduce a new decentralized TF Grid database layer based on the Parity Substrate blockchain technology

We encourage anyone looking to experience the power of the TF Grid – and to help shape its future – to join [our growing testing community](https://t.me/joinchat/BwOvOxxgK59GmRoZ2_sM0w)!

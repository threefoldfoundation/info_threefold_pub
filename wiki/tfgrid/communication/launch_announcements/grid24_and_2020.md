**2020 was a big year for ThreeFold**, filled with technological milestones and emerging partnerships. We are now in the beginning of another crucial year. No other project out there has what we have from a technology standpoint. Capacity is available in 23 countries and growing. And our partnership funnel is running like crazy.

**2021 is the year of our breakthrough** – we are confident, and excited!

## First, some highlights from 2020

Here are some of the major highlights from last year:

- In April, we announced the launch of the second generation of the ThreeFold_Grid with the 3Bot SDK
- In June, the TFT moved to Stellar and was listed on both Liquid & BTC Alpha
- We created a full new web presence and expanded our wikis
- We added 10+ partners to our blockchain ecosystem (DigiByte, Dash, Harmony, TomoChain, & more)
- We Worked with Solidaridad, Climate Action Project, & EarthHealth Partnership on key partnerships

## Grid 2.4 is live on testnet!

Our first big announcement of the year is regarding **our latest grid update, version 2.4**, which is now live on testnet. You can start testing tomorrow, January 13th, 2021. Grid 2.4 brings **a series of new components** as well as **improvements to older components** that make it **easy for people to get started** and to **feel the power** of what **the grid** can bring.

Some of the highlights of the 2.4 release:

- **[edge Virtual Data Center (eVDC)](https://vdc.threefold.io/)**: a Kubernetes-compatible cloud with great features around security and networking. Deploy any Linux-compatible workload anywhere in our grid within minutes. We have full support for the Kubernetes ecosystem like Helm templates, Prometheus monitoring, traffic ingress controller, & more.
- **Planetary FileSystem**: a virtual filesystem compatible with Linux, OS X and soon Windows. You can now from anywhere in the world store data on our grid with following incredible features: quantum safe, unbreakable, read/write caching, & more. This storage interface can be used for all your storage requirements: backup, archive, fileserver, and even small databases.
- **[ThreeFold Now Community Tools](https://now.threefold.io/)**: easy-to-deploy tools on top of the eVDC to create your own professional workgroups or leisure communities. Included are amazing tools like alternatives to YouTube, Slack, Zoom, & Office, developer tools, and more. (Please note TF Now is not new in this release, but there have been some updates.)
- **Python-based Developer SDK**: super easy-to-install and use for developers.

We will provide more specifics soon, and you can also find more info on most of these solutions in [our December Product Updates video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7BH_o9JbW0).

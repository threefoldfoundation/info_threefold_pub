![](img/planedintro.jpeg)

Today we’re proud to introduce you to PlanED by Take Action Global (TAG), a member of the Conscious Internet Alliance.

Over the last five years, TAG has built a community of thousands of teachers globally which allows them to connect to children and teachers in refugee camps. But they face limitations because of affordability of / access to Internet.

With ThreeFold as the infrastructure, and utilizing elements of 3bot technology, TAG will develop PlanED, a peer-to-peer education platform that affordably and effectively bridges refugees with educators and students around the world.

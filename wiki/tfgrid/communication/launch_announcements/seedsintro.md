![](img/seedsintro.png)

Today we’re proud to introduce you to SEEDS - Regenerate Money, a member of the Alliance for a Conscious Internet. SEEDS is a financial system that serves, rewards and finances people and organizations committed to creating a healthier and more equitable planet.

ThreeFold and SEEDS are a natural pairing of infrastructure + financial system that together provide an essential foundation for shaping a civilization that is fully decentralized, more resilient, rewarding, and regenerative.

We are big fans of SEEDS and their team 💚 and we encourage you to take a closer look at the project.

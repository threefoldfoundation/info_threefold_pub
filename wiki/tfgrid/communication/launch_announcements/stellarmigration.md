# May 21: TFT Migration to Stellar

Dear existing ThreeFold_Token Holders,

We are excited to share that the migration from the Rivine Blockchain to the Stellar Blockchain has started.

Stellar is an open-source network for currencies and payments. Stellar makes it possible to create, send, and trade digital representations of all forms of money – dollars, pesos, bitcoin – pretty much anything. It’s designed so all the world’s financial systems can work together on a single network.

The ThreeFold_Token (TFT) now lives on the Stellar_Blockchain. TFT Holders benefit from a big ecosystem of proven wallets and mediums of exchange. Stellar’s mission to promote financial inclusion is aligned with ThreeFold’s vision for an inclusive Internet.

All you need to do is convert your TFT to TFTA on Stellar.

For most of you, the conversion will happen automatically the next time you open your ThreeFold_Connect app, but make sure to update the app first.

If you’re unsure of anything or if you have not migrated from the ThreeFold app to ThreeFold_Connect yet, [here](tf_chain_to_stellar_chain) is a simple guide to make sure the conversion goes smoothly. 🙏

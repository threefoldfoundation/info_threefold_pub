## What’s New on ThreeFold_Grid 2.2

### Introducing 3Bot: Your Virtual System Administrator

![](img/3botadmin.png)

Your 3Bot has been born. 3Bot is your virtual system administrator, it is your only way to manage your workloads on top of the TF Grid.

This gives you the best peer2peer decentralized experience, you don't have to use a central admin panel.
We are now launching a more user-friendly experience with the 3Bot that could be deployed and hosted online by using a 3Bot deployer on your web browser.

With a couple of clicks, you can get your 3Bot will be activated and ready to use.

=======

- [**Deploy a hosted 3Bot on Mainnet**](http://deploy3bot.grid.tf)

For more advance people and developers, you can also deploy a 3Bot locally by using the local SDK.

#### New 3Bot Features

- Built-in Wallet
- Back up of your 3Bot data
- Deployed Workloads Display.

Please visit our **[TF Grid 2.2 Manual](https://manual2.threefold.io/)** to read more about the 3Bot features.

### Capacity Pools

**[Capacity Pools](https://manual2.threefold.io/#/3bot_capacity_pools)** is an exciting feature made available on TF Grid 2.2.

It is a feature that enables you to reserve capacity on the grid to deploy your solutions.

In just a few clicks, you will be able to reserve IT capacity for your projects directly by creating multiple capacity pools and linking them to your project’s workload.

### FreeTFT is being replaced by Testnet TFT

On Monday, we will replace FreeTFT with Testnet TFT. There is a probability that we will use FreeTFT again in the future, but for now, we will be using Testnet TFT on testnet. This means we can open up our testnet to a general audience, and enable people who want to test to do so by using a free currency (Testnet TFT) and start using the newest features.

**Benefits**

- All-in-one dashboard with all the features
- More exposure on our newer codes
- People don't have to pay for resources used on testnet
- You automatically receive some testnet TFT when you logged in to your deployed 3Bot on testnet for the first time.

On testnet, IT Capacity reservation is done by using Testnet TFT.

You can request for free 1000 Testnet TFT for each request on this **[Testnet TFT Faucet](http://gettft.testnet.grid.tf)**

Please keep in mind that you can only receive Testnet TFT on a testnet Stellar wallet. Please read our tutorial on how to get a testnet Stellar wallet **[here](https://manual2.threefold.io/#/testnet_gettft)**.

If you would like to deploy a 3bot on 2.2 mainnet, then the only accepted token on mainnet would be TFT. if you would like to reserve capacity on mainnet with TFTA, you would need to do a [conversion from tfta to tft](tfta_to_tft).

### Introducing: ThreeFold NOW

To fully realize the vision of an Internet built for everyone, by everyone, we need easy-to-use and easy-to-deploy alternatives to the online tools and applications we use most.

You can now be among the first people to test some demo versions of these solutions made available on top of the ThreeFold_Grid via the **[ThreeFold NOW Marketplace](http://marketplace.threefold.io)**.

> The current TF NOW Marketplace is currently made available on testnet for testing purposes.

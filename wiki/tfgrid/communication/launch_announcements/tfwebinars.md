# August 24: Upcoming Community Webinars

![](img/tfwebinars.jpeg)

Hello all, the following two Wednesdays we will host community webinars to introduce new folks to ThreeFold.

If you’re new, please join! We think you’ll find the session beneficial.

Also, we'd be grateful if you'd encourage specific people in your network to join in, to see what we’re all about.

# Webpresence Update

In an ongoing effort to keep the community up to speed with the latest information, we’ve updated our web presence to reflect the two key areas of focus:

1. the ThreeFold_Grid, hosted on threefold.io (https://threefold.io/), and contains information related to the technology, farming and the ThreeFold_Token, and

2. the ThreeFold Foundation, hosted on threefold.foundation (https://threefold.foundation/), and contains information related to the larger mission, vision and ecosystem support.

In addition, we've updated our wikis quite significantly to make information more clear and navigation more simple.

We’re excited to bring you more content and announcements over the coming weeks, as well as additional ways to participate on the grid and in our growing community. Thank you for being with us! 🙏

# Planet Positive vs. Planet Friendly Farming

![](img/becomefarmer.jpg)

There are two types of Farming:
- Planet Friendly Farming (previously referred to as Do-it-Yourself).
- Planet Positive Farming (previously referred to as Certified).

> Planet Positive farming will be available as from H2 2021. We are currently in the process of setting up agreements between  ThreeFold Farmers & the ThreeFold Foundation.

## Planet Friendly Farming

By design, Zero OS can enable up-to 10x energy efficiency as compared to other operating systems. It is super lightweight (200 MB) and delivers all the [storage and compute primitives](internet4_tfgrid_primitives) an Internet may need. 

ThreeFold also offers a Farmer Bot to facilitate the farm's management, hich includes power management, ensuring the 3Node is powered only when needed.

## Planet Positive Farming

Planet Positive Farming enables Farmers to go beyond energy efficiency and regenerate our planet. This is facilitated by the ThreeFold Foundation, which provides a mechanism to offset their carbon usage by 3x. This permits the farm to cover its carbon footprint and to participate in climate action.

The equation is very simple: (3Node (SU + CU) Kwh per month x local Kwh carbon footprint) x 3

### Planet Positive Criteria

```
Planet Positive Farming = Trust (Proof-of-Authenticity) + Energy (SU + CU) +  Accessibility
```

1. Trust = Proof-of-Authenticity

- A process by which your farm is evaluated by other farmers (authentic or not).
- Other Farmers verify the authenticity of your farm.
- Through an affiliation model, you can get authenticated by onboarding other farmers.
- This system creates a chain of trust.
- The more your farm is said to be authentic, the more points you get, the higher your reputation.

2. Energy 

- KG of carbon used by your node. (For now it can easily be calculated based on SU and CU, but this will be measured in the future).
- Measured by the network of trust that verifies the authenticity of the information.

3. Accessibility

- Connectivity: Stable uptime.
- Power Sources: Spreading the power sources.
- IP Addresses: The amount of IP addresses made avaialble.
- Location: Connecting 3Nodes to new locations e.g. Remote areas or Refugee camps

ThreeFold believes that such a system will ensure an network of trust that rewards the biggest contributors to the ThreeFold Grid.

### Planet Positive Advantages

- Higher CPR rewards.
- Eligible for Cloud Workloads.
- Better reputation and visibility on the ThreeFold Grid.
- Priority over ThreeFold support.

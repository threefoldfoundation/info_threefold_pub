# Farming Reward Calculator

We have created a calculator to allow you to simulate your potential return on investment of becoming a Farmer. Different nodes will produce a different Storage Units (SU), Compute Units (CU), and Network Units (NU)

## Example

- Titan v2.1 costs: 885 Ex VAT (see https://shop.threefold.tech/)
    - depending the location you buy from there is different tax, will slightly change the params
- Has following capacity
    - 8 logical cores
    - 32 GB memory
    - 1000 GB SSD disk space
- This results in: CU: 7.75, SU: 2.25
- Is a certified node (means 25% extra farming rewards)
- Simulation Parameters
    - 0.06 TFT as starting TFT price
    - 1 USD as 5Y TFT price
    - 0.15 power cost per kwhour
- Monthly farming reward for CU/SU = 458 (60 months)
- This result in: 27475 TFT, which means 27475 USD if TFT price would be 1 USD at that period
- Power cost of the node over 5Y: 263 USD
- Net Profit in USD = 26327 USD
- This results in an ROI of 2294%
- This gives you 12725 TFT additional compared to buying TFT at this stage (compared to cost of 3node)

> Calculation done 17 Nov 2021, Disclaimer: this is a simulation only, no promises are made. <BR>
> TFT is not an investment instrument, its an Utility Token for Internet_Capacity <BR>
> Token price might be higher at point of connection, in this simulation we took USD 0.06.

### Variation 1

- Same Titan v2.1 but with Europe tax and Public IP Address
- Net Profit in USD = 26940 USD, 10,500 TFT extra compared to straight TFT buy, ROI: 2034%

### Variation 2

- Same Titan v2.1 but with Europe tax, 5Y TFT price only 0.5
- Net Profit in USD = 12413 USD, 9,775 TFT extra compared to straight TFT buy, ROI: 937%

### Variation 3

- Same specs of Titan v2.1, assembled by farmer, cost price 950 EUR, 5Y TFT price of 1 USD, not certified
- Net Profit in USD = 20767 USD, 6,147 TFT extra compared to straight TFT buy, ROI: 1712%

## Remarks

- The [Farming Logic v3 document](farming_reward) describes how many TFT your node will receive. 
- Thanks to our sales model you also do not have to sell the capacity of your server(s), as we leave incentive for our threefold_channel 's to run a business on top of it.

## Risks

- ThreeFold Technology is not working
  - _FACT: The technology is already working today_
- The ThreeFold token does not appreciate in value
  - _Unlikely: The cloud business by itself is growing and with increasing update of the TF Grid as an alternative to the large cloud vendors there will be token scarsity._
  - _The ThreeFold_Council can make changes the business model to create more scarsity (e.g. burn a higher percentage of the tokens)._
- Digital Currencies become illegal
  - _Unlikely: TFT has a utility - TFT represents  unit of compute and storage capacity._
  - _Even if this would happen despite all logic, then normal FIAT currencies can be used.  The token is only a effective means of value exchange._

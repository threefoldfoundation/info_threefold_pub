# ThreeFold Farming

ThreeFold Farming is the process of connecting Internet capacity to the ThreeFold Grid.

## What is Farming?

## A simple model for anyone to partake

Farmers are independent people and organizations that connect hardware to the ThreeFold Grid.

Anyone can become a Farmer, and there's no technical knowledge required. ThreeFold's autonomous system does all the heavy lifting, making it easy for anyone to join.

## What kind of hardware can become a 3Node?

Any Intel or AMD server type hardware that contains compute and/ or storage can connect to the ThreeFold Grid. Farmers need to download Zero OS and boot their hardware. 

Once booted by Zero OS, the hardware becomes a 3Node, and its total capacity will automatically be detected and registered on the blockchain database. We call this proof-of-capacity.

## Proof-of-Capacity

The proof-of-capacity records three Internet resources from the 3node (server):

- Compute Capacity (CPU)
- Memory Capacity (RAM)
- Storage Capacity (SSD/HDD)

The proof-of-capacity is stored on a distributed storage system and hashed (fingerprinted). The hashes verify the authenticity of the report and are stored in the minting transactions of the blockchain. 

4 days after the end of each month, the TFTs are transferred to the farmer. The minting consensus needs to be achieved before minting can actually happen.

## Why become a farmer?

The Internet represents the largest economy in the world and is growing at a rapid pace. Here are a few statistics:

- Infrastructure growth: +125 Zettabytes (1 099 511 627 776 GB) of capacity to be connected in the next 5 years
- Revenue growth: +$800 Billion in revenue expected for the cloud market by 2025.
- Demand Growth: +70 Billion smart devices to join the Internet of Things network by 2025. 
- +1 Billion people to go digital in the next 5 years.

The ThreeFold Grid offers the most scaleable, secure and sustainable infrastructure to supply the increasing Internet demand. Learn more about the ThreeFold Grid [here](grid_home).

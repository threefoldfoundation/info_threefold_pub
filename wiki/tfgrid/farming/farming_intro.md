## A simple model for anyone to partake

Anyone can become a Farmer, and there is no technical knowledge required. ThreeFold's autonomous system does all the heavy lifting, making it easy for anyone to join.

## What kind of hardware can become a 3Node?

Any Intel or AMD server type hardware that contains compute and/ or storage can be connected to the ThreeFold Grid. Farmers need to download Zero-OS and boot their hardware.

Once booted by Zero OS, the hardware becomes a 3Node, and its total capacity will automatically be detected and registered on the blockchain database. We call this Proof-of-Capacity.

## Why becoming a Farmer?

### Internet and Its Global Demand 

The Internet represents the largest economy in the world and is growing at a rapid pace.

The ThreeFold Grid offers the most scaleable, secure and sustainable infrastructure to supply the increasing Internet demand.

### Sovereign and Recurrent Wealth 

By participating in the expansion of the ThreeFold Grid, Farmers earn TFT on a monthly basis. ThreeFold Token has value - it represents a unit of reservation of Internet Capacity on the ThreeFold Grid. With the infinite expansion of the ThreeFold Grid and the scarcity of mechanism of the TFT, there will be a constant increase in demand while a decrease in supply, thus providing value of its holders/Farmers.

## ThreeFold Farm Management & Setup

To create a Farm and manage it, you need a 3Bot. If you don’t have one yet, head to the [Get a 3Bot](sdk:3bot_deployer) section before continuing.

In this section, we will help you get started with your farm:

- [Configuring a Farm](farm_init)
- [Prepare a 3Node](3node_prepare)
- [Booting a 3Node over USB](boot_3node_usb)
- [Managing your Farm & Nodes](3bot_farm_mgmt)
- [Managing your Farm wallet](configure_wallet)
- [Configure public IPs](configure_farmer_ips)
- [Migrate a farm to a hosted 3bot](farm_migration) (for experts)

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach us on the [Farming Section on the Forum](https://forum.Threefold.io/c/Threefold-grid-support/farmer-discussion).

>Simulations are NOT investment advice nor should they be looked at in this way. The scenarios shown are by no means a guarantee and no one can predict the future of yields exactly as they are heavily dependent on factors beyond anyoneâ€™s control. The DAO could also decide to change parameters or farming, which could have a different result. We invite the community to review and give feedback and make proposals for necessary changes [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/the-new-farming-calculator-a-much-simpler-way-to-calculate-your-potential-farming-rewards/1773/4)

## Scale Out Node

The scale out node v1 is optimized for ThreeFold Farming in a rack coming in at a 0.5 unit, making it very dense and efficient node.

|         |              |      |               |
| ------- | ------------ | ---- | ------------- |
| CPU     | AMD          | 24   | logical cores |
| Memory  |              | 128  | GB            |
| Storage | HD Capacity  | 14   | TB            |
| Storage | SSD Capacity | 2000 | GB            |
| Chassis | 1/2 depth    |      |               |


Properties

- only 1/2 depth in rack (can put back to back, so 80 fit in 1 rack)
- 120-180 watt per out_node
- 2 more SSD's can be added (optional, max 4 TB total additional) 


### Cost For Capacity

Cost for capacity which can be achieved for 100% certified capacity with licenses is

- +-3 EUR per CPU unit (CU)
- +-1.5 EUR per Storage Unit (SU)  : 1 TB for archive storage


## Suggested Sales Prices

Sales price are in relation to market prices.
  
- to compare with market prices see 
- [cost comparison](pricing)

We suggest you sell at following prices (which are very disruptive in relation to market prices)

- CU = compute unit, 15 USD is a super good price (on market between 20 and 200)
- SU = storage unit, 10 USD is a super good price (on market between 20 and 160)
- NU = network unit, 0.1 USD

ROI is 2-20 times depending future TFT Price, see your farming simulator.

There is a generic simulator you can find on https://info.threefold.tech/#/simulation

### Simulation For A Single Scale Out Node

what can be done with 1 node.

As you can see this is a super efficient solution from cost & capacity perspective.

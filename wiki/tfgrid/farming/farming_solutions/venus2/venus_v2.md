## CPR 

####  The cloud production rate (CPR) of the Venus v2 is 70

(cloud production rate = 1.5 x CU + SU)

#### Farming Tokens at this CPR Number. (Tokens received for adding capacity to the grid) 

In a DIY Setting a farmer receives 14 TFT per CPR for the duration of 60 months.

- 70 * 14 = 980 TFT per month*
- 980 * 60 = 58.800 TFT total 



Tokens for cultivation (usage of the 3Nodes capacity) are not included in this total as that is hard to predict.

#### Cultivation Tokens (Tokens received for usage of your capacity.)

As Cultivation is harder to predict we can't put any numbers against it.
Of all cultivated tokens on a 3Node the farmer receives 10%.

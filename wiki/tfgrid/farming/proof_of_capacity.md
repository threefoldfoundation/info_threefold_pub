# Proof Of Capacity

ThreeFold Token ("TFT") is an Utility Token and is generated by ThreeFold Farmers ("Farmer") under the process called Farming.

![](img/circular_tft_.png)

Each day, Zero-OS along with ThreeFold Chain ("TFChain") - ThreeFold Blockchain - registers the capacity being made available by Farmers. The blockchain will calculate the reward per Farmer. 

Learn more about the Calculation and Modalities for Farming Rewards [here](farming_reward).

The Farmer's wallet is registered in the ThreeFold Chain and can be modified by the Farmer.

<!--- TBD time TFT are minted by the TFChain in accordance to the farming rewards and distributed to the farmer wallet. -->


| Percentage | Description    | Remark                           |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 100%       | goes to Farmer | Allows for a pure Utility Token. |


Example of a Farming Reward calculation see [here](farming_calculator).

## ThreeFold DAO rules in Relation To Proof-of-Capacity

- Rewards per CU/SU in TFT are registered in TFChain per 3Node at registration time. For certified Nodes, the CU/SU reward was specified at sales/promotion time, this process is managed by threefold_tech. All of this information is public and can be see by everone of the community as per 3Node and Farmer.
- The rewards per CU/SU are fixed over time for 5 years.
- CU/SU calculated from Resource Units, [see this doc](resource_units_calc_cloudunits)
  - Certified Node gets 25% more farming rewards.
  - TFT pricing is pegged to USD (pricing changes in line with TFT/USD rate)
- Rewards for NU and IP Addresses are dynamic, the prices get revised on regular basis and DAO consensus needs to be achieved for that. The TFChain knows how the NU and IP Addresses were used and as such the reward can be calculated for the Farmer. 
- Minimum SLA = Service Level Agreement
  - Minimal SLA's need to be achieved before the farming reward can be earned (uptime, bandwidth, latency, ...)
  - for certified node farming today: 99.5% uptime, which is upto 3.6h downtime per month.
  - for diy node farming today: 99% uptime, which is upto 7.2h downtime per month.
  - we are still working on right SLA definition for network, is not measured today
  - If SLA (Service Level Agreement) was not achieved for 3 consecutive months, then the 3Node will have to re-register which means the CU/SU reward will be recalculated at that time and re-registered in TFChain for that node, just like a new one.
- All CU/SU rewards are staked (locked to farmer account) until 30% (measured over 3 months) is used or 24 months since registration. 

> Has to be confirmed by Wisdom Council. Will only be fully active starting TFGrid 3.1.

### Still to resolve

- How to deal with nodes where storage, compute capacity is added or removed.
- The way how we calculage CU needs to be improved, people can use old hardware and get too much rewards, we are looking for ways how to mitigate that.

## Proof-of-Fraud

- ThreeFold is developing a way of how to detect possible fraud in Proof-of-Capacity, more details will be provided in Q1 2022.
- Without disclosing all details, it is based on TPM chip as well as dynamic generated code which executes random Proof-of-Capacity checks.
- If the Proof-of-Fraud code finds fraud e.g. trying to fake the Proof of Capacity 
  - Node gets put in disabled and fraud mode
  - Implying that Farming stops and the farmer will have to re-register.
  - The Farmer reputation will decrease and therefore will be transparently shown to everyone in the ecosystem. 
  - If token is in staking, the TFTs are locked permanently.

## Proof-of-Utilization.

Each ThreeFold Grid user can use the farmed capacity. The TFChain will track the utilization of this capacity. We call this **Proof of Utilization**.

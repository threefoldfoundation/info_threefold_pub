# Proof Of Utilization

ThreeFold Token ("TFT") is an Utility token and gets generated by ThreeFold Farmers, see [Proof Of Capacity](proof_of_capacity).

Each ThreeFold Grid user can now use this capacity. The ThreeFold Chain ("TFChain") - ThreeFold Blockchain will track the utilization of this capacity. This process is called **Proof-of-Utilization**. Each hour the utilization is being tracked on the blockchain and charged to the capacity's user. 

**How is the cost calculated:** 

- Discount calculated in line with the amount of TFT users have in their accounts on TFChain. Leanr ,more about the discount [here](staking_discount_levels).
- TFTs get charged from the user's account and are distributed using table below.

| Percentage | Description                            | Remark                                                                   |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 35%        | needs to be burned                     | results in more TFT burned compared to generated once grid more mature.  |
| 10%        | to TF Foundation                       | used to promote the manage the project.                                  |
| 5%         | to Staking Pool for TFChain Validators | used to reward the people who run the TFChain 3.0 blockchain validators. |
| 50%        | for solution providers & sales channel | managed by [ThreeFold DAO](tfdao).                                       |

## ThreeFold DAO rules in Relation To Proof-of-Utilization

- Each solution provider and sales channel gets registered in TFChain and as such the distribution can be defined and calculated at billing time.
- For billing purposes, ThreeFold DAO will check if it is from a known sales channel or solution provider. If yes, then the billing smart contract code will know how to distribute the TFTs. If the channel of solution provider is not known, then the 50% will go to a DAO owned Community Grant Wallet.
- The Community Grant Wallet allows for grants to the ThreeFold Community, ThreeFold DAO consensus needs to be achieved.
- For Certified Farming, [ThreeFold Tech](threefold_tech0) can define the solution & sales channel parameters, these are channels as provided by ThreeFold Tech.
- Burning can be lowered to 25% if too many tokens would be burned, ThreeFold DAO consensus needs to be achieved.

> Has to be confirmed by Wisdom Council. Will only be fully active starting TFGrid 3.1.

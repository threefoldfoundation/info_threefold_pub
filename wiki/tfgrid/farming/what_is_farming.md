- Farmers need to invest in the computer hardware and receive ThreeFold Tokens for doing so.
- Such a computer is called a 3Node and can be installed at home, in an office or any locaton  where existing internet connectivity is available.
- Every month that the 3Node has been up and running and connected to the internet for a long enough time TFT are being earned by the farmer.
- Everyone in the world can now use this compute, storage and network capacity to deploy apps onto those 3nodes in stead of in a centralized datacenter.
- A 3node runs our operating system ZOS which provides for good security and the most efficient utilization of hardware.

Farming is the concept of expanding the internet with more Internet Capacity (Network, Compute & Storage Capacity).

Farmers invest in computer hardware called 3Nodes to provide Internet Capacity and are consequently rewarded with ThreeFold Token (“TFT”). The 3Node can be installed at home or any location where existing internet connectivity is available. Every month that the 3Node is up and running and connected to the internet, Farmers receive TFT. 
 
Everyone in the world can now use this Compute, Storage, and Network Capacity to deploy apps onto these 3Nodes instead of using centralized datacenters.

# How are ambassadors to promote the development of applications to run on the ThreeFold_Grid?

## Question

ThreeFold's solution is described as “computing at the edge”; a low-cost, energy-efficient computing solution offered close to where consumers and businesses are. It is meant to be an alternative to the likes of Amazon Web Services (AWS) where today you can buy a slice of their stack, including certain applications such as their e-commerce engine, plus the inherent security they offer for $x/month. Users of AWS can add their own specific solutions and integrate them within Amazon’s architecture. So with that said, how do consumers or businesses add their applications/solutions on to the ThreeFold_Grid? What applications, if any, is ThreeFold offering? Is there any thought of encouraging companies like Amazon to migrate some of their services to the ThreeFold_Grid?

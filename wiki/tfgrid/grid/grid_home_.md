# Overview

The ThreeFold Grid is a Peer-to-Peer and autonomous Internet Grid that provides game-changing performance and empowers new possibilities. With +500 servers delivering +80,000,000 GB of online storage across 110+ locations in 21+ countries, the ThreeFold Grid is the largest Peer-to-Peer Internet in the world. TCP/IP isn’t used on the ThreeFold Grid which makes it completely private and secure for the users. All the applications and servers are completely decentralized. 

The ThreeFold Grid is made up of many servers called 3Nodes that are distributed around the world by independent people and organizations called ThreeFold Farmers (“Farmers”). 3Nodes runs a unique operating system called Zero-OS, a lightweight and ultra-efficient open-source operating system. Each user can then access the ThreeFold Grid with a Digital Self which is a virtual system administrator that executes the commands (reservation of capacity, sending messages, store files, build applications, etc.) directly on the operating system level via a Smart Contract for IT.

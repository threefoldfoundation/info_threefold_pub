![](img/tf_principle_banner.png)

The ThreeFold_Grid is the most advanced peer-to-peer Internet Grid in the world. It is built by independent people, called farmers, that together create a pool of inter-connected compute, network and storage capacity.

The ThreeFold Token is used to buy cloud_capacity on the TF_grid. This Cloud_Capacity can be used to host any application on the grid such as websites, storage applications, internet services and more.

### Farmers produce the cloud capacity.

- Farmers purchase and operate servers that they connect on the TF Grid by downloading and installing ThreeFold's software. By connecting capacity, a farmer mints the ThreeFold_Token(s).
- Farmers come in many different sizes and shapes.
- Farmers can be individuals that have a spare hardware or some spare cash.
- Farmers can also be companies that actively go out and find people to invest in their business of building farming sites. An example of a Farmer company is [Green Edge Cloud](https://www.greenedgecloud.com/).

## Grid Users

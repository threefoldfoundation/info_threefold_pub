## ThreeFold Grid Description

The ThreeFold Grid is a Peer To Peer and autonomous Internet Grid that provides game-changing performance and empowers new possibilities. With +500 servers delivering +80,000,000 GB of online storage across 110+ locations in 21+countries, the ThreeFold Grid is the largest Peer To Peer Internet in the world. TCP/IP isn’t used on the ThreeFold Grid which makes it completely private and secure for the users. All the applications an serves are completely decentralized

The ThreeFold Grid is made up of many servers - 3Nodes - that are distributed around the world by independent people and organizations called ThreeFold Farmers (“Farmers”). The production of Internet Capacity on the ThreeFold Grid is called Farming. 

3Node  runs a unique operating system called Zero-OS, a lightweight and ultra-efficient open-source operating system. It delivers 3 primitive functions: **Storage Capacity**, **Compute Capacity** (in the form of highly-optimized containers) and **Network Capacity** (for running the network services). There is no shell, local or remote attached to Zero-OS - It does not allow for inbound network connections to happen. Moreover, given its shell-less nature, Farmers cannot issue any commands nor access its features. Therefore, Zero-OS enables a “zero-people” - Fully autonomous - Internet. This implies that hackers cannot get in and also eliminates human error from the paradigm. 

All 3Nodes connected to the ThreeFold Grid are registered in a database called the ThreeFold Directory (“TF Directory”), which registers the internet capacity available on the ThreeFold Grid Explorer. This process is called Proof-of-Capacity.

Being a decentralized process and involving the participation of the community to expand and grow the ThreeFold Grid and solution, Farmers are rewarded with ThreeFold Token.

Users can then access the ThreeFold Grid with 3Bot, a virtual system administrator that executes the commands (reservation of capacity, sending messages, store files, build applications, etc.) directly on the operating system level via a smart contract for IT.

The ThreeFold Grid is approaching its 3rd major release and many things are already possible on top of it. ThreeFold didn’t stop at only building the Peer-To-Peer communications infrastructure. In parallel, Peer-To-Peer applications and services are also being built such as the [ThreeFold Peer-to-Peer Cloud](@cloud_home), marketplace, and a software development kit amongst others. Any application which can run on Linux can run on top of the ThreeFold Grid with many advantages.

## ThreeFold Token

ThreeFold ("TFT") is the official medium of exchange on the ThreeFold Grid. It represents a unit of reservation of capacity (Compute, Storage and Network).

### ThreeFold Farmers produce the Internet Capacity.

ThreeFold Farmers ("Farmers") are independent people or organization who purchase and run servers or computers called 3Node which they connect onto the ThreeFold Grid. By connecting capacity (Compute, Storage and Network), Farmers mint or create ThreeFold Tokens and they are rewarded for participating in the expansion of the people's internet. 

Example of a Farmer: [Green Edge Cloud](https://www.greenedgecloud.com/).

## Grid Users

![](img/different_users_tfgrid.jpg)

### Developers use the Internet Capacity

Anyone can build applications and services on the ThreeFold Grid as an alternative to doing it on centralized cloud like Google Cloud or Amazon Web Services.

### A limitless environment for experts

A software development kit (SDK) is available and provides expert developers with great automation tools to scale their applications and services limitlessly.  

### A platform for communities to thrive

ThreeFold created a marketplace of peer-to-peer applications that can be hosted by any community around the world to benefit from real privacy and freedom on the Internet.

### End Users

End-users use decentralized applications and consume resources on the ThreeFold Grid for which they pay in ThreeFold Tokens.

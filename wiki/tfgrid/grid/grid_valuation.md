# ThreeFold Grid and its utility token - TFT - are valuable.

Demand for decentralized capacity is exploding with increasing data demands and trends such as the MetaVerse, Web3, Web2, Edge Computing, 5G, AI, VR, IoT and more.

## The potential of the ThreeFold Grid

![](img/missing_layer_.jpg)

The ThreeFold Grid ("Grid") is a peer-to-peer Internet/Cloud grid that provides more efficient solutions than centralized alternatives.

Considering the current global market growth, let's assume that the Grid achieves a 10% share of the 1000 billion public cloud market by 2025. This would translate to a 100 billion USD (10% market share) demand to utilize the capacity of the TF Grid through TFT as the medium of exchange for capacity. 

## The ThreeFold Token (TFT) and its scarcity 

A ThreeFold Token ("TFT") represents a unit of reservation of Internet Capacity (Compute, Storage and Network) on the ThreeFold Grid ("Grid"). Considering the infinite expansion of the Grid, the limited supply and the burning mechanism of the token, the ThreeFold Token will grow consequently, providing values to its holders.

According to the market demand, ThreeFold Farmers are incentivized to contribute to the Grid expansion.

In alignment with the above assumptions - 10% market share - the amount of TFT in circulation on the market will be limited.

## ThreeFold aims to connect the unconnected

Despite the fast-growing global cloud market, the distribution of data centers is still mostly concentrated on the western world (mainly Northern America) and certain parts of Asia.

- This [source](https://wikileaks.org/amazon-atlas/map/) lists the data centers of the current market leader in Internet Capacity
- Other major market players follow the same patterns: 
  - [Oracle](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/oracle-launches-four-new-cloud-regions-across-four-continents)
  - [Cloudwirx](https://www.cloudwirx.com/datacenters)
  - [Microsoft](https://yellowduckguy.wordpress.com/2018/03/15/microsoft-worldwide-data-center-locations/)

This unequal distribution of capacity can be explained by the high requirements in infrastructure, electricity, and security to operate large scale data centers which requires large amount of money invested in the infrastructure. Beside this, the price of Compute and Storage Capacity on the market is too high for the global population to be able to afford it. 

Please have a look at our pricing comparison compared to others on the market, [here](@cloud_pricing_compare).

With the ThreeFold Grid and its ecosystem, ThreeFold can also tap into the areas of our world where big cloud providers can't, thanks to its decentralized and autonomous nature. Also, this represents an opportunity for locals to boost their digital economies.

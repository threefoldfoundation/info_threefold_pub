### How does 3BOT fit into the ecosystem?

3BOT is a software template which can be use to perform many different tasks.

- It us used to run a distributed exchange for a number of cryptocurrencies.
- It is used to manage and share personal information to other 3BOTs in the system.
- It is used for finding, agreeing and contracting storage and compute capacity.
- It us used to deploy, operate and maintain IT architectures.

These are a number of the main tasks of the 3BOT at grid launch - it will be given a lot more tasks during the expansion and lifetime of the grid.

### What are the applications that do and don’t run on our grid?

There are a number of technoical features that TFTech has enabled and/or build into the grid based on the generic direction IT is taking globally. A conscious dicision is made to _not_ support virtual machine workloads as this is seen as old / currenct technology - certainly not the technology that will fuel the future of IT. Various research instituion and firm have reports on how containerised technology is the future for future IT workloads on the internet of things.

The keyword here is athat we are aiming for decentralised applications. A decentralised grid of compute and storage capacity is ideally suited to take on distributed -- decentralised applications. These applications are currently being developped from (old) centralised applications by the major (enterprise) software vendors. How

### Which use cases to look out for?

Initially we would like to take the success forward that has been achieved by the market leader in containerisation: Docker. Containerisation technology has been around for a long time but it is only in recent years that it has grown in popularity. Containerised workloads are the ideal start workloads for the TF Grid.

The best one to get started with are IT architectures build by a few (<10) containers. These smaller architectures can be ported to the TF grid without much effort. The benefits of the TF grid over a different container solution are:

- the Zero-OS runs containers "natively". This means there is no other software to install, maintain and update.
- container files can be stored in central (https://hub.grid.tf) repositories and is personalised, secure and private respositories. The central hub software is available to anyone.
- container files are stored in such a way that the files are cryptographically signed. IT is very difficult to tampler with these files.
- container files are provided to the platforms on which the container runs over the network

### Which sort of developers?

The best results are achieved if young developers are approached. They are open to new environments and languages and for these there is a certain appeal to this new system. If we go to more seasoned / older developers they will have a tendency to "stick" to what they know and will resist investing time in something new (and unproven). Obviously the exception to this rules proves it.

### What exactly will we have ready for the January launch and by when?

The January launch marries the financial blockchain which has been in operation since early 2018. During 2018 the grid has been build buy adding individual farmers and larger farming cooperatives. In january there will be a substantial amount of compute and storage capacity in the grid and available for real use cases. The launch

### Who are our competitors? (GIG? Vapor.io? Redhat? Docker?)

### Are we a docker? Or can someone build docker on top of us?

### What’s the difference between Zero-Bot & 3Bot?

### Is TFTech looking for clients? If so, what profile? What is our value proposition? What products do we offer?

### Do we need a separate wiki for TFTech?

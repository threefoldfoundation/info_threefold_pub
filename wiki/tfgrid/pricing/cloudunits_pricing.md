| Network Addressing | description                                | mUSD                  | mTFT                  |

- mUSD = 1/1000 of USD, mTFT = 1/1000 of TFT
- TFT pricing pegged to USD (pricing changes in line with TFT/USD rate)
- **current TFT to USD price is $TFTUSD** , calculated on $NOW
- pricing is calculated per hour for the TFGrid 3.0
- pricing of certified capacity is 25% more (x 1.25)

The pricing per hour is calculated as follows:
```
Cost = #CU * cu_price + #SU * su_price + #NU * nu_price + #IPv4 * IPv4_price + #Unique_names * name_price + #Domain_names * domain_name_price
```

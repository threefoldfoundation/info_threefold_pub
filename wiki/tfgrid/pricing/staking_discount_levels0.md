TFChain charges the user for proof_of_utilization every hour. TFChain will calculate the discount based on amount of TFT available in the account of the user on TFChain (not on Stellar or any of the other blockchains we also support). This is an automatic form of staking, the user does not have to do anything to have this benefit. For network related services its max 40% discount.

## Example for 40% discount

- Let say my Internet Capacity consumption on ThreeFold Grid is 10 TFT per hour worth.
- Scaled to 6 months it gives 10 TFT * 24h * 30d * 6m = 43,200 TFT which is the minimum amount to have in my account to be eligible for 40% discount
- Scaled to 18 months it gives 10 TFT * 24h * 30d * 18m = 129,600 TFT which is the minimum amount to have in my account to be eligible for 60% discount
- So if I have 60,000 TFT in my account on TFChain, this means I will get 40% discount.
- I donâ€™t have enough tokens to get to 60% discount.
- Taking into account the 40% discount I will effectively pay this consumption 6 TFT per hour as long as the amount of TFT in my account belongs to the [43,200; 129,600] range (see calculation above).

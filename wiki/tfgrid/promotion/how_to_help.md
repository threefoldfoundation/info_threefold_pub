# How You Can Help!

Want to help, but not quite sure how? Here are some ideas:

## Support the Project: Buy the Token!

The ThreeFold_Token is the payment instrument used to reserve Internet capacity and services on the ThreeFold_Grid. (Please note that the ThreeFold_Token is not an investment instrument & should not be seen as such.)

For now, the grid is open and ready for use only by a technical audience (see below) but anyone can buy the token as a sign of support for the project. More [here](how_to_buy).

## Be The Internet: Become a Farmer!

With merely an energy source, a network, and a 3Node needed, the ThreeFold_Grid brings the possibility of Internet access to everyone, everywhere.

You can participate in the growth of the grid and generate tokens by buy buying a 3Node and plugging it into an energy source and an Internet connection.

More on farming on [the farming website](https://farming.threefold.io) or on our [wiki](https://wiki2.threefold.io/#/farming_intro).

## Test the Waters: Deploy on the Grid!

Today, the ThreeFold_Grid is ready for testing for those with a technical background. You can find out more on our [cloud website](https://cloud.threefold.io) or [marketplace website](https://marketplace.threefold.io).

If you'd like to get involved in our testing community, you can join [here](https://t.me/joinchat/BwOvOxxgK59GmRoZ2_sM0w)!

## Get Your Hands Dirty: Offer Support!

If you have the time and would like to get involved in supporting the Foundation, please let us know either on [the forum](https://forum.threefold.io) or by emailing us at info@threefold.io. Based on your background and interests, we'll find a way to get you involved.

## Build Community: Spread the Word!

We have a few places where you can find regular / updated content:

- [Announcement Telegram Channel](https://t.me/threefoldnews)
- [Forum](https://forum.threefold.io)
- [Website](https://threefold.io)
- [Facebook](https://facebook.com/ThreeFold.io)
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/company/threefold-foundation/)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/threefold_io)
- [Blog](https://threefold.io/blog)
- [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/ThreeFoldFoundation)

Please follow along and feel free to share with your networks when you are inspired to do so. Remember it's always best to add a line of text or two when you share the post rather than just hitting "share now." If you don't know what we're talking about, reach out to spreadtheword@threefold.io and we'll walk you through it.

Additionally, we have [a folder in this section](threefold_content) with shareable content you can simply download and post on your social network or messaging platform of choice.

### Introduce Someone Specific to ThreeFold

While blasting your network might be effective, we'd really recommend thinking about who specifically in your circles would be interested in what we are building, and getting in touch with them one-on-one.

Are you connected with people who want to do good for the planet? Make sure they know about the challenges of today's Internet and the reasons [why we're doing what we're doing](https://consciousinternet.org/about).

Encourage them to follow along and spread the word with their own networks. Do you know developers or IT professionals? Invite them to check out our [peer-to-peer cloud](https://cloud.threefold.io) or join [our testing community](https://t.me/joinchat/BwOvOxxgK59GmRoZ2_sM0w). Have any friends who are journalists or run podcasts? We'd love to talk with them (spreadtheword@threefold.io).

We believe heavily in the network effect. Say for example that there are 5,000 people in our community. If each existing person introduced even just one new person each week to ThreeFold, and then they all did the same the following week, we'd have 80,000 people in our community in one month.

- Week 1: 5,000 existing + 5,000 new = 10,000 total
- Week 2: 10,000 existing + 10,0000 new = 20,000 total
- Week 3: 20,000 existing + 20,000 new = 40,000 total
- Week 4: 40,000 existing + 40,000 new = 80,000 total

You know best how to get in touch with the people in your circles so we'll leave it to you. But again, we're here to help if you're stuck!

### Help Us Form a New Partnership

We believe strongly that partnerships are the way forward. We have built a responsible solution / foundation for conscious organizations. Dozens of organizations have already signed on or expressed their intent to sign on to move to and/or build on top of the ThreeFold_Grid â€“ and we invite more to do the same.

[The Alliance for a Conscious Internet](https://consciousinternet.org)

### Seek Out New Communities

There are many groups on Facebook and LinkedIn, for example, that would and should be interested in what we are building. All it takes is a bit of digging to find them. Once you do, introduce yourself and share a bit about ThreeFold. Tap into what the group or community is all about.

Importantly, PLEASE avoid "spamming" as much as possible (just blasting about ThreeFold without any context, or posting across many groups at the same time).

# Awareness Campaign June-July 2020

## Purpose

- TFT sales for funding [Token Grant Program = TGP](threefold:grantoverview)
- Farming: 10.000 new nodes on the ThreeFold_Grid.

> It's time to find funding for the ThreeFold project <BR>
> It's time to mobilize our communities (ambassadors, alliance for conscious internet, ...) <BR>
> It's time to startup our Farmer Programs again.
> **It's NOT time for finding liquidity for our farmers or early TFT buyers**

## Status

- TFGrid = the network of capacity
  - TFGrid 2.0 is live
  - TFGrid 2.1 will be delivered in June/July (see [roadmap](cloud:roadmap))
  - TFGrid 2.2 will be delivered in Summer (see [roadmap](cloud:roadmap))
- TFT2.0 has been released on Stellar, BTCAlpha & Liquid

> Do not expect lots of liquidity to happen in next months, we expect organic growth. <BR>
> We do not hype for crypto gamblers on exchanges, we hope they will not use us for speculation purposes. <BR>

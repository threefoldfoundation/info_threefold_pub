# Roadmap For TFChain 3.0

![](img/limitedsupply.png)

## Phase 1: proof of authority blockchain

<!-- Proof of authority blockchain run by group of 9 TFGuardians. -->

<!-- Each Guardian is independent and has all best intentions for TF in mind. -->

This is implemented using parity/substrate.

Pro

- [X] super safe 
- [X] very well decentralized
- [X] easier to get started
- [X] if a disaster would happen its easier to fix and re-establish consensus compared to phase 2
- [X] super high performance
- [X] 100% automated, no need for any guardian to do manual step for std operation
- [X] rather straight forward process for upgrade of code (and still decentralized)

Con

- [ ] some people believe this might be less decentralized compared to delegated proof of stake blockchain

<!-- Future we could at any point in time decide to run more nodes e.g. 99 or so, there is no limit to this. -->

## Phase 2: Delegate Proof of Authority/Stake Blockchain

Delegate Proof of Authority/Stake Blockchain, where everyone in the world will be able to use their TFT to put voting power in the hands of one or more chosen blockchain nodes. This principle is called delegated proof of stake. By staking your tokens on the blockchain you earn a reward and secure the network.

We are investigating & doing research if it serves a purpose to go there for the future.

Pro

- [X] super safe 
- [X] best possible centralization (if people deploy more TFChain nodes.)

Con

- [ ] harder to provide a solution to disasters (acts of god).
<!-- - [ ] upgrades happen by the people who provide the nodes, which means that actually we could argue that maybe this is not more decentralized compared to Phase 2. Ofcourse people could redraw their delegated stake but who actually is checking on this. -->

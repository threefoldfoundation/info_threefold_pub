- On top of this digital twin anyone can build experiences: digitaltwin_experiences

### Zero-OS

ZeroOS (ZOS) is the operating system which allows the 3Nodes to be used to provide IT capacity required by the solutions running on the TFGrid.

### 3Nodes

Computers (servers) are the low-level provider for the IT capacity of the Cloud, we call them TFGrid Nodes or in short a `3Node`.

3Nodes are servers which run the ZOS software.

They provide storage, compute & networking capacities. Together, 3Nodes make up the capacity layers for the TF Grid.

### Explorer

Today we have about thousands of 3Nodes across the grid see our https://explorer.grid.tf

# TFGrid Capacity explorer

![](img/tf_grid.jpg)

Today we have about thousands of 3Nodes across the grid see our https://explorer.grid.tf

> see https://explorer.threefold.io/

The TFGrid explorer shows TF Grid usage statistics and provides details about all the active nodes and gateways.

Using the `Capacity finder` panel, you can filter out the nodes based on their farm and resource units.

By clicking on a node or a gateway, you deploy the information view:

The information view lets you inspect a specific node or gateway in more details. Next to basic information (like farm, location, uptime), you can also find the primitives currently provisioned on the node and how much resource is available on the node or gateway.

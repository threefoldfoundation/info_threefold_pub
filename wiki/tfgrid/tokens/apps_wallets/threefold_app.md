# Using the ThreeFold App

**Note: We are phasing out the ThreeFold App. Please install [ThreeFold Connect](threefold_connect) if you are a new user. If you need support, please use the chat functionality on https://threefold.io.**

ThreeFold created a ThreeFold App, available for iOS and Android phones. This ThreeFold App includes a ThreeFold Wallet for safely keeping your ThreeFold_Tokens offline, and receiving and sending ThreeFold_Tokens from/to other offline and online wallets.

The ThreeFold App allows you to manage multiple ThreeFold Wallets and addresses at the same time.

Follow the steps below to set up your ThreeFold Wallet, and receive and send your first ThreeFold_Tokens:

- [Registration and login](#iyo)
- [Set your PIN code](#pin)
- [Get your Private Key](#seed)
- [Receive tokens](#receive)
- [Send tokens](#send)
- [Transactions](#transactions)

<a id='iyo'><a>

## Registration and login

To use the ThreeFold App you simply need to download the ThreeFold App available in the Appstore or Google Play Store. Register using your email address

<a id='pin'><a>

## Set your PIN code

After having registered on your ThreeFold App, your next step will be to set a PIN code, which you'll need later each time when you start the ThreeFold App, and access your ThreeFold Wallet.

## Get your Private Key

After having set your PIN code, a private key will be created for you. This key is a unique combination of 24 words, also referred to as a **seed**.

To access your private key, click **Settings** in the app menu:

Then click **Security**:

And finally, click the ThreeFold private key:

We recommend making a screenshot of this screen, print it on paper and store it safely offline.

> **ThreeFold does not have any access to or maintain records of your private key. It is your personal responsibility to keep your 24-word private key in a safe place.**

> **Do not share your private key with anyone, it is strictly personal. Losing your private key means losing access to your wallet and all your ThreeFold_Tokens.**

> **Anybody with access to your private key can take ownership of your ThreeFold wallet and ThreeFold_Tokens**

> **To access your wallet from another wallet (on another phone or online) you will need your private key (seed), without this private key your account cannot be recovered on another device or online wallet.**

## Receive tokens

To acquire ThreeFold_Tokens you have two options:

- Buy them on a public cryptocurrency exchange, such as BTC-Alpha, as documented here below in [Buying ThreeFold_Tokens using BTC-Alpha](#btc-alpha), and then transfer them from your online TFT wallet at BTC-Alpha to your offline ThreeFold App TFT wallet
- Or receive ThreeFold_Tokens from someone who sends them to you from their online or offline TFT wallet, as documented here below in [Send tokens](#send)

For both cases you need your offline TFT wallet address, which you can look up in the ThreeFold App by navigating to your wallet from the navigation menu, and then clicking the **Receive** button:

![Receive](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threefoldfoundation/info_tokens/master/docs/img/wallet-receive-300.jpg)

Here you see the TFT wallet address in two formats:

- As a QR code, which can be scanned from the wallet app of the sender, as documented here below in [Send tokens](#send)
- Or in full-text format, which can be copied by clicking it, and then paste the address into a chat or email message.

## Send tokens

Also sending ThreeFold_Tokens is simple. First, navigate to your wallet from the ThreeFold App navigation menu, and then click the **Send** button:

![Send](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threefoldfoundation/info_tokens/master/docs/img/wallet-send-300.jpg)

To specify TFT wallet address of the receiving party you have two options:

- Either scan the QR code from the sender
- Or enter (copy/paste) the full-text address

Next, to the recipient address, enter the amount to send, and you're ready to go.

> The current transaction fee is 0.1 TFT.

## Transactions

Next, to receiving and sending tokens, your TFT wallet also keeps track of all your transactions and your balance of course.

To see your balance click **Transactions** in your wallet:

![Transactions List](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threefoldfoundation/info_tokens/master/docs/img/wallet-transaction-list-300.jpg)

Under the number of ThreeFold_Tokens you own (your balance) you see all (send and receive) transactions. Clicking any of the transactions will show you all the details of the transaction:

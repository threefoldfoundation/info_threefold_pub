Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a blockchain network built for running smart contract-based applications. BSC runs in parallel with Binance's native Binance Chain (BC), which allows users to get the best of both worlds: the high transaction capacity of BC and the smart contract functionality of BSC.

### Advantages

- Lots of liquidity
- Automatic price governance, thanks to DEFI technology like [Pancake Swap](https://pancakeswap.finance/)
- Low transaction fees
- Fast

## ​​​​​How to get TFT on PancakeSwap

1. You need to have a wallet configured for Binance Smart Chain, either via MetaMask (browser extension and mobile app) or on Trust Wallet (mobile only).
- Instructions to set up Metamask for BSC: [here](tft_bsc_metamask)
- Instructions to set up Trust Wallet for BSC: [here](tft_bsc_trustwallet)
2. You will need BNB in that wallet to cover transaction fees. Low amounts are sufficient, as the average transaction on BSC does not exceed 50 ct USD.
3. Go to [Exchange PancakeSwap](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x8f0fb159380176d324542b3a7933f0c2fd0c2bbf) and wait for TFT to appear. This may take a few seconds.
> Again, please note it is very important to use the official contract address: **0x8f0fb159380176d324542b3a7933f0c2fd0c2bbf**. Do not use links or contract addresses from unverified sources!!
4. Click through the security warning.

# Learn how to build the People's Internet

> No matter who you are or what you're creating, you can be part of the People's Internet. This library contains everything you need to start building using ThreeFold and paves the way for the future of the decentralized Internet.

The ThreeFold library describes the ThreeFold open source project, a peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure built from the ground up for scale. The different sub libraries cover key aspects of the project:

- [The ThreeFold Grid](@grid_home)
- [The ThreeFold Cloud](@cloud_home) 
- [ThreeFold Farming](@farming_intro)
- [The ThreeFold Token](@tokens_home)
- [Technology](@technology)

> For more insides take a look at our [Deep Dive Meetups 2022](threefold_internal:deepdive_meetups) where we cover each key aspect of the project together with our community.

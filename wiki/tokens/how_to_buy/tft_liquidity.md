## What are Liquidity Pools?

Liquidity Pools are an integral part of DeFi systems and can be understood as a “collection of tokens or digital assets stored in a smart contract” on a decentralized exchange (DEX). Liquidity pools allow users to buy or sell such assets in a decentralized way and are used to enhance decentralized trading, lending/borrowing and other DeFi services. Users get rewarded with a cut of the fees generated in the process to incentivize them to become liquidity providers.

## What does it mean to drive liquidity on Stellar or Binance Smart Chain?

Stellar and Binance Smart Chain offer multiple great solutions and basically everything we need, so it’s crucial for us to start building our own liquidity there. Since every asset and currency starts with zero liquidity when issued on such platforms, it is up to the community to put liquidity to use for trading, e.g. by adding liquidity to pools with TFT. The more liquidity we provide on Stellar and Binance Smart Chain, the more we contribute to creating and sustaining a healthy market for TFT there – while simultaneously attracting others to get involved in TFT.

## How can I provide liquidity (participate in Liquidity Pools)?

Typically in order to join a liquidity pool, one has to have an equivalent equal amount of TFT and other paired currency for each trading pair. Here are the links where you can find how to participate in Liquidity Pools:

# ThreeFold Token (TFT) for Beginners

While the Token section of this wiki is quite built out, we can understand that some people might not have experience with tokens in general. So, here's a few details to guide you through.

### Is ThreeFold Token a crypto currency?

A crypto currency is a currency living on a blockchain. TFT lives on the Stellar public blockchain, therefore it is a crypto currency. 

### Why using a digital currency instead of fiat?

Using a digital currency on a blockchain has many benefits. It can be used by both people and machines, it is ultra-secure and decentralized (not controlled by a government or a company). 

### Is TFT like Bitcoin?

In some ways yes and in other ways no. They are both digital currencies but they have different purposes and reasons for existing. There are plenty of articles out there explaining Bitcoin. The ThreeFold_Token is the official medium of exchange on the ThreeFold_Grid. Anyone, who wants to use ThreeFold_Grid, reserve IT capacity and deploy applications will need TFT.

### What is the process for buying ThreeFold Tokens?

There are different ways to get TFT. Here's a guide through each of them, starting with the easiest ones. 

#### Quick Exchange

A [quick exchange](tft_liquid_quick_exchange) provides an easy and safe way to buy TFT and other tokens. All you need to do is sign-up, choose TFT as a buying options and the currency/token you wish to buy them with. You can buy up-to $150 of TFT without a Know-Your-Customer (KYC) procedure. If you want to buy more, you'll have to go through the KYC procedure, which should take only a few minutes. The quick exchanges proposed by ThreeFold are fully regulated in Singapoure and Japan, licensed and meet FSA standards.

#### Through Farmers

You can also buy TFT from Farmers, for example from [Mazraa](mazraa), the ones that produce TFT by connecting capacity to the ThreeFold Grid. All you have to do is to get in touch with them and issue a request to buy TFT.

#### Public Exchanges

Exchanges are businesses that let you buy TFT using fiat or other tokens. They have custody over any funds and tokens you deposit there you send it to another wallet that is under your full control. Public Exchanges require a KYC procedure, which should take only a few minutes. The public exchanges proposed by ThreeFold are regulated and licensed by respective regulatory bodies. 

#### Wallets

Wallets are trusted by many to buy TFT and other tokens. They propose many buying options that include fiat and other tokens. Similarly to exchanges, some wallets may require you to do a KYC. 

#### Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)

Decentralized exchanges are open marketplaces for TFT and other tokens. They connect buyers and sellers directly.

Instead of using a trusted third party to safeguard funds in the transaction, they use code. The seller's TFT will only be transferred when the payment is guaranteed. This type of code is known as a [smart contract](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp).

This means there are fewer geographical restrictions than with centralized alternatives and they do not necessarily require a KYC procedure (most of them don't). If someone is selling what you want and accepting a payment method you can provide, youâ€™re good to go. DEXs can let you buy TFT with other tokens, PayPal or even in-person cash deliveries.

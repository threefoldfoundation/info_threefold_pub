## Proof of Capacity = Creation/Minting of TFTs

ThreeFold Tokens are rewarded when new capacity (storage & compute) is added to the ThreeFold Grid by the means of the 3Nodes being connected.  

[Farmers](farming_intro) farm (mine) capacity for the ThreeFold Grid. A ThreeFold Farmer is ThreeFolds more sustainable equivalent of cryptocurrency miners.

The amount of TFTs that are created by farmers depends on three variables:

1. Compute Capacity (CPU)
2. Memory Capacity (RAM)
3. Storage Capacity (SSD/HDD)

Learn more about the Farming Rewards [here](farming_reward).

Tokens are burned as result of utilization which leads to the number of tokens being limited.

## Proof-of-Utilization

see [Utilization Token Flow](proof_of_utilization)

## Limited Supply & Liquidity Drivers

See [Limited Supply & Liquidity Drivers](tft_limited_supply)

## Vesting

Many tokens are in vesting wallets. See [Vesting](vesting_overview).

## The ThreeFold Grid is valuable

See [how valuable the ThreeFold Grid is](grid_valuation)

# Vesting Program

In March of 2021 we introduced the vesting program, which was a voluntary process created for token holders to show their support for the project. Token holders were able to put their tokens in a [vesting pool](vesting_pool), thus locking their tokens temporarily.

[The vesting pool](vesting_pool) was designed so that tokens get unlocked according to two factors; time and the token value. 

# Vesting Program Overview

- [Vesting Pool](vesting_pool) - An introduction to how the vesting scheme is setup.
- [TFGrid Concensus mechanism = blockchain](consensus3)
- [How Vesting Works](how_vesting_works) - Gives you insight to how vesting wallets work, how tokens are unlocked, and why multi-signature wallets are used.
- [How to do your own simulation](vesting_simulator_howto) - Shows you how to download the simulator yourself.
- [How to Unvest](unvesting)

### A Quick Example 

The following table shows how vesting would work out on month 0 and month 9 in relation to the token price.

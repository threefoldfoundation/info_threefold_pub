# Vesting Program

In March of 2021 we introduced the vesting program, which was a voluntary process created for token holders to show their support for the project. Token holders were able to put their tokens in a [vesting pool](vesting_pool), thus locking their tokens temporarily.

[The vesting pool](vesting_pool) was designed so that tokens get unlocked according to two factors; time and the token value. 

You can learn more about the vesting process, how to vest and unvest your tokens by reading the articles included on thwe Vesting Program Overview below.

> DISCLAIMER: Token Vesting is a voluntary process. Each person who choses to vest their tokens understands that this will get their tokens locked up.

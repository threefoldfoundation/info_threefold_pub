# The Humanized Internet

![](img/the_humanized_internet.png)

*The Humanized Internet* is working to use new technologies to defend the rights of vulnerable people, and give every human being worldwide secure, sovereign control over their own digital identity.

### Purpose

Over one billion people worldwide have no official identity, making them vulnerable to abuses like incarceration and human trafficking. That includes 230 million children under five, and ten million stateless people. Not only can a secure identity help defend their rights, but it can provide access to essential services like education, health and banking. It can enable them to be sovereign individuals.

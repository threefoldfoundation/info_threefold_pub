*The Vlinder* is a private finance app providing a helicopter view of your payments, crypto wallets, and cash expenses while automatically estimating your carbon footprint allowing to contribute to community projects and make a profit from offsetting CO2 emissions by investing in green products with high return.

### Purpose

COVID-19 mitigation is a great example of what can be done when we act together. Vlinder helps people become more mindful about their consumption behaviour and investments and empowers to act on climate change. If we join forces, we can face any challenge, even climate change.

### Status Today

MVP launched on June, 2020 - Vlinder mobile app

Vlinder is raising seed round of 500,000 EUR at 3m valuation during August, 2020.
Focusing on market research and analysis. Performing user tests. Securing market fit, right messaging.

Vlinder is working on tokenization of mangrove / rainforests in partnership with [Generation Blue](generationblue) creating: 
- Security token (for CO2 credit dividendes)
- CO2 credit token (verified carbon credits that people can buy to offset their footprint)
- Proof retirement token (to retire carbon credits as proof of persons/enitities CO2 offsets)

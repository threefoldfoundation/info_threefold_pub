## changes to our current ambassador model

In progress Q2 2021:

- ThreeFold circles will be created as mechanism to provide added value to the ThreeFold community
    - it would be amazing if you want to be part of one or more of these circles as admin, contributor, story owner, circle owner or member
    - all circles are on https://circles.threefold.me/
    - all circles are 100% transparent to the world (purpose, activities, achievements, ...)
    - each circle will have their own telegram channel (later 3bot) and limited to members of the circle
    - each circle will have a fixed meeting room on https://freeflowconnect.threefold.me/ (our own zoom alternative)
    - each circle can ask funding to ThreeFold Dubai (in TFT) to organize their operations.
- Ambassador Cafe 
    - will be a circle organized online meeting place (by the community itself, not ThreeFold)
    - will organize online events where everyone is free to join depending the topic
    - can optionally use FreeFlow Pages for communication
    - the old ambassador cafe telegram will close down
    - a new official ambassador group telegram will be created for the ambassadors that are participating in the new model - please be reminded the forum is a very good place to ask questions

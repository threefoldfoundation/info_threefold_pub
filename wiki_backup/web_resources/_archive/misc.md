- Registered Nodes
- Online Nodes
- Number of Countries
- Number of Farms
- Number of Cores, Memory, HDD, and SDD.

Besides giving insight to the Grid, the ThreeFold Explorer also allows farmers to manage their capacity/farm, and users can use it to reserve capacity and deploy workloads on the tf grid.
